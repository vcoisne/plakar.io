# Dropbox

The Dropbox integration package for Plakar allows you to back up and restore
data to and from Dropbox cloud storage, as well as host Kloset stores directly
within Dropbox. It is built on top of [Rclone](https://rclone.org/), a
command-line program to manage files on cloud storage, and supports Dropbox as
one of its many backends.

The integration provides three connectors:

| Connector type            | Description                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Storage connector**     | Host a Kloset store inside a Rclone remote.            |
| **Source connector**      | Back up a Rclone remote into a Kloset store.           |
| **Destination connector** | Restore data from a Kloset store into a Rclone remote. |

**Requirements**

- Rclone must be installed, and at least one Dropbox remote must be configured.

**Typical use cases**

- Cold backup of Dropbox folders
- Long-term archiving and disaster recovery
- Portable export and vendor escape to other platforms

## Installation

To interact with Dropbox, you need to install the Rclone Plakar package.

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab label="Pre-built package" >}}

Pre-compiled packages are available for common platforms and provide the
simplest installation method.

> [!NOTE]+ Logging In
>
> Pre-built packages require Plakar authentication. See
> [Logging in to Plakar](../../guides/logging-in-to-plakar) for details.

Install the Rclone package:

```bash
$ plakar pkg add rclone
```

Verify installation:

```bash
$ plakar pkg show
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab label="Building from source" >}}

Source builds are useful when pre-built packages are unavailable or when
customization is required.

**Prerequisites:**

- Go toolchain compatible with your **Plakar** version

Build the package:

```bash
$ plakar pkg build rclone
```

A package archive will be created in the current directory (e.g.,
`rclone_v1.0.0_darwin_arm64.ptar`).

Install the package:

```bash
$ plakar pkg add ./rclone_v1.0.0_darwin_arm64.ptar
```

Verify installation:

```bash
$ plakar pkg show
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

To list, upgrade, or remove the package, see
[managing packages guide](../../guides/managing-packages/).

## Generate Rclone configuration

Install Rclone on your system by following the instructions at
[https://rclone.org/install/](https://rclone.org/install/). Then, run the
following command to configure Rclone with Dropbox:

```bash
$ rclone config
```

You will be guided through a series of prompts to set up a new remote for
Dropbox.

For Rclone v1.72.1, the configuration flow is as follows:

1. Choose `n` to create a new remote.
2. Name the remote (e.g., `mydrive`).
3. Enter the number corresponding to "Dropbox" from the list of supported
   storage providers.
4. Leave `client_id` and `client_secret` empty to use Rclone's defaults, or
   provide your own if you have them.
5. Choose to open the browser for authentication.
6. Confirm the settings.

To verify that the remote is configured, run:

```bash
$ rclone config show mydrive
```

And to verify you have access to your Dropbox files, run:

```bash
$ rclone ls mydrive:
```

The output should list the files and folders in your Dropbox.

## Connectors

The Rclone package provides storage, source, and destination connectors to
interact with Dropbox via Rclone.

You can use any combination of these connectors together with other supported
Plakar connectors.

### Storage connector

The Plakar Rclone package provides a storage connector to host Kloset stores on
Rclone remotes.

Via["Store snapshot via<br/>Rclone storage connector"]

  Kloset["Kloset Store"]
end

Source --> Plakar --> Via --> Kloset
{{< /mermaid >}}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Configure

```bash
# Import the rclone configuration as a storage configuration.
# Replace "mydrive" with your Rclone remote name.
$ rclone config show | plakar store import -rclone mydrive

# Initialize the Kloset store
$ plakar at "@mydrive" create

# List snapshots in the Kloset store
$ plakar at "@mydrive" ls

# Verify integrity of the Kloset store
$ plakar at "@mydrive" check

# Back up a local folder to the Kloset store
$ plakar at "@mydrive" backup /etc

# Back up a source configured in Plakar to the Kloset store
$ plakar at "@mydrive" backup "@my_source"
```

#### Options

These options can be set when configuring the storage connector with
`plakar store add` or `plakar store set`:

| Option       | Purpose                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| `passphrase` | The Kloset store passphrase |

### Source connector

The Plakar Rclone package provides a source connector to back up remote
directories accessible via Rclone.

end

Plakar["Plakar"]

Via["Retrieve data via<br/>Rclone source connector"]

Store["Kloset Store"]

{{< /mermaid >}}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Configure

```bash
# Import the rclone configuration as a source configuration.
# Replace "mydrive" with your Rclone remote name.
$ rclone config show | plakar source import -rclone mydrive

# Back up the remote directory to the Kloset store on the filesystem
$ plakar at /var/backups backup "@mydrive"

# Or back up the remote directory to a Kloset store configured with "plakar store add"
$ plakar at "@store" backup "@mydrive"
```

#### Options

The Rclone source connector doesn't support any specific options.

### Destination connector

The Rclone package provides a destination connector to restore snapshots to
remote directories reachable over Rclone.

Plakar["Plakar"]

Via["Push data via<br/>Rclone destination connector"]

subgraph Destination["Rclone Remote"]
  FS["Data"]
end

Store --> Plakar --> Via --> FS
{{< /mermaid >}}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Configure

```bash
# Import the rclone configuration as a destination configuration.
# Replace "mydrive" with your Rclone remote name.
$ rclone config show | plakar destination import -rclone mydrive

# Restore a snapshot from a filesystem-hosted Kloset store to the Rclone remote
$ plakar at /var/backups restore -to "@mydrive" <snapshot_id>

# Or restore a snapshot from the Kloset store configured with "plakar store add store …"
$ plakar at "@store" restore -to "@mydrive" <snapshot_id>
```

#### Options

The Rclone destination connector doesn't support any specific options.
