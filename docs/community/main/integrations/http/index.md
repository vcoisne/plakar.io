# HTTP(S)

The HTTP(S) integration allows Plakar to use an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint as a
Kloset store backend. Its used to connect to a Kloset store exposed by
`plakar server`. The integration is pre-installed in Plakar `v1.1.0` and later
and requires no additional setup. The integration provides one connector:

| Connector type    | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Storage connector | Host a Kloset store on any HTTP or HTTPS accessible endpoint |

```
