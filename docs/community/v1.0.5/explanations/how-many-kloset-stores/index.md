# How many Kloset Stores should you create

A common design question when setting up backups with Plakar is how many
**Kloset Stores** to create.

Should you use:

- A single store for everything
- Separate stores for servers, SaaS data, or cloud buckets
- One store per system?

There is no universal answer. The right choice depends on how your data is
structured and how you want to manage it.

## The key idea: Kloset Stores are deduplication boundaries

You can view a Kloset Store as a **deduplication unit**. Data is deduplicated
**within** a store, but **never across stores**. This means the number of stores
you create directly affects:

- Storage efficiency
- Encryption boundaries
- Operational complexity

Understanding how similar your data is, matters more than how many sources you
have.

## When a single Kloset Store makes sense

Using one store is often the simplest option.

This works well when:

- Backup sizes are relatively small
- Data across sources is largely similar
- You want minimal operational overhead

### Example: Similar data across many servers

Imagine 10 servers, each with 100 GB of data. Most of that data is identical:
operating systems, shared libraries, common applications.

By storing all backups in a single Kloset Store, Plakar can deduplicate the
shared data. Instead of storing 1 TB, only the unique portions are kept.

This approach maximizes deduplication and keeps management simple.

## When multiple Kloset Stores are better

Multiple stores are often preferable when data sets have little or no overlap.

### Example: Independent data sets

Consider 10 S3 buckets, each containing 100 GB of unrelated data.

Because there is no meaningful overlap, a single Kloset Store would provide
little deduplication benefit. In this case, separating data into multiple stores
can simplify management without increasing storage usage.

## Separating stores for security or policy reasons

Deduplication is not the only reason to create multiple stores.

You may also want separation when:

- Different data sets require different encryption keys
- Access policies differ
- Data has different retention or compliance requirements

### Example: Same data, different trust boundaries

You might store internal backups and external customer backups separately, even
if the data structure is similar, so each store can use a different encryption
key.

## Small data sets and simplicity

For many small backups (configuration files, small databases, metadata), the
deduplication benefit may be minimal regardless of layout.

In these cases, using a single Kloset Store is often still the right choice
simply because it is easier to operate.

## Summary

When deciding how many Kloset Stores to create, consider:

- How similar your data sets are
- Whether deduplication efficiency matters
- Whether data needs to be isolated for security or policy reasons
- How much operational complexity you are willing to manage

In practice, many environments start with a single store and introduce
additional stores only when a clear need appears.
