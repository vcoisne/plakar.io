# Managing packages

Integration packages extend Plakar with connectors for cloud storage providers,
databases, and other systems. This guide covers the full lifecycle of a package:
installing, listing, upgrading, and removing.

Plakar ships intentionally clean with only base connectors such as the
filesystem connector. Plakar can be extended using integrations such as S3,
SFTP, PostgreSQL, or any other integration only when you need it, keeping the
base install small and dependency-free.

Integrations are also versioned independently from Plakar itself, so you can pin
a connector to a specific version or upgrade it without touching the rest of
your setup.

## List installed packages

To see which packages are currently installed:

```bash
$ plakar pkg list
```

## Install a package

### Pre-built package

Pre-built packages are hosted on Plakar's infrastructure and require you to be
logged in to download them. To log in:

```bash
$ plakar login
```

> [!NOTE]+ Passphrase
>
> In v1.0.6 and below, only interactive login is supported. Non-interactive and
> token-based login are available from v1.1.0 and above.

Once logged in, install a package by name from the official plugin registry
(e.g. the S3 integration):

```bash
$ plakar pkg add s3
```

### Local archive

If you built the package from source or have a `.ptar` file on hand, pass the
path directly:

```bash
$ plakar pkg add ./s3_v1.0.0_darwin_arm64.ptar
```

This does not require a Plakar account.

## Upgrade a package

To upgrade to the latest available version, remove the existing package and
reinstall it:

```bash
$ plakar pkg rm s3
$ plakar pkg add s3
```

Upgrading preserves existing store, source, and destination configurations.

## Remove a package

```bash
$ plakar pkg rm s3
```
