# Logging In to Plakar

Plakar works without an account by default. Logging in is optional but it
unlocks additional features such as installing pre-built packages hosted on
Plakar's servers (so you don't have to build them from source) and alerting
service which can notify you by email on important issues like when a backup
fail.

## Logging In

### Using GitHub

```bash
$ plakar login -github
```

### Using Email

```bash
$ plakar login -email myemail@domain.com
```

## Enabling Alerting

After logging in, enable alerting to send backup metadata to Plakar's servers
for reporting:

```bash
$ plakar service enable alerting
```

Enable email notifications:

```bash
$ plakar service set alerting report.email=true
```

Alerting sends non-sensitive metadata (backup status, timestamps, sizes) to
power the reporting dashboard and email notifications. Your backup data never
leaves your system.

## Installing Pre-Built Packages

Once logged in, you install pre-built integration packages hosted on Plakar's
servers:

```bash
$ plakar pkg add s3
$ plakar pkg add sftp
$ plakar pkg add rclone
```

Without logging in, you can still build these integrations from source.

## Verify Login Status

Check if you're logged in:

```bash
$ plakar login --status
```

This displays your login status.
