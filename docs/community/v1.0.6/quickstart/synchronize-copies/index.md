# Synchronize multiple copies

In this guide, we will create a second copy of the Kloset Store created in
[Part 1 of the Quickstart](../first-backup).

This second copy will be stored on a S3-compatible storage service, but the same
logic applies to any other storage location supported by **Plakar**.

## Requirements

This guide assumes that:

- **Plakar** is installed on your system (see the
  [Installation guide](../installation)).
- A Kloset Store exists on your local filesystem at `$HOME/backups` with at
  least one snapshot (see [Part 1 of the Quickstart](../first-backup)).

## Why create multiple copies?

Keeping multiple backup copies dramatically reduces the risk of total data loss
by **turning a realistic single-site failure into an extremely unlikely event
when data is replicated across independent locations** (see the
[why should you keep several copies of your backups](../../guides/why-several-copies)
guide).

**Plakar** is designed to make it easy to synchronize a Kloset Store to another
location.

## Login to install pre-built integrations

By default, **Plakar** works without requiring you to create an account or log
in. You can back up and restore your data with just a few commands, with no
external services involved.

However, logging in unlocks optional features that improve usability and
monitoring. Among these features, it adds the ability to install the pre-built
integrations hosted on our infrastructure.

In this quickstart, we will use the S3 integration, which requires the
integration to be installed first. Therefore, we need to log in.

You can log in through the CLI:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab label="With Email" >}}

```bash
plakar login -email <youremailaddress@example.com>
```

Substitute in your own email address and follow the prompt. You can then check
your email and follow the link sent from `plakar.io`.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab label="With GitHub" >}}

```bash
plakar login -github
```

Your default browser will open a new tab where you can authorize plakar to use
your GitHub account for authentication. Follow the prompts to complete the
login.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

## Install the S3 integration

Run the following command to install the S3 integration:

```bash
$ plakar pkg add s3
```

If you already have the S3 integration installed and want to update it, remove
the existing version first and then install the latest one:

```bash
$ plakar pkg rm s3
$ plakar pkg add s3
```

You can list all installed integrations to confirm the S3 integration was
installed successfully:

```bash
$ plakar pkg list
s3@v1.0.7
```

## Set up S3-compatible storage

For this quickstart, we will use a local MinIO instance as our S3-compatible
storage service. If you have access to an actual S3-compatible service (such as
AWS S3, Wasabi, Backblaze B2, etc.), you can skip this step and use the
credentials provided by your service provider instead.

Run the following command to start a MinIO instance using Docker:

```bash
$ docker run -d --name minio -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

This command starts a MinIO server accessible at `http://localhost:9000`, with a
web interface available at `http://localhost:9001`. The default access key is
`minioadmin` and the secret key is also `minioadmin`.

## Configure Plakar

To let **Plakar** know about the S3 storage, we need to configure a new store.
We will call this store `s3-backups`.

Run the following command to create the new store:

```bash
$ plakar store add s3-backups \
  location=s3://localhost:9000/mybucket \
  access_key=minioadmin \
  secret_access_key=minioadmin \
  use_tls=false
```

This command creates a new store named `s3-backups` that points to the
`mybucket` bucket on the MinIO server running at `localhost:9000`. It uses the
access key and secret key provided above. The `use_tls=false` option is
specified because we are connecting to a local server without TLS.

_`use_tls` should be omitted or set to `true` when connecting to production
S3-compatible services that use TLS._

## Initialize the Kloset Store

For now, the Kloset Store points to a bucket that does not exist yet. We need to
create it by initializing the store:

```bash
$ plakar at "@s3-backups" create
```

This command initializes the Kloset Store at the S3 location, creating the
necessary bucket and structure to hold the backups.

Note the `@` symbol before the store name. This is an alias, which indicates
that we are referencing a Kloset Store from the configuration. Without the `@`,
**Plakar** would interpret `s3-backups` as a filesystem path.

> [!NOTE]+ Escaping on Windows
>
> On Windows, make sure to use double quotes (`"`) around the store name to
> avoid issues with the `@` symbol being interpreted by the shell. On Unix-like
> systems, quotes are often unnecessary.

The passphrase prompt will appear: **you do not have to enter the same
passphrase** as the local Kloset Store, but you can if you want to.

Plakar will automatically create the bucket if it does not already exist.

## List snapshots

If you list the snapshots in this new store, you will see that it is currently
empty:

```bash
plakar at "@s3-backups" ls
```

## Synchronize the local Kloset Store to S3

Now, let's synchronize the local Kloset Store at `$HOME/backups` to the S3
Kloset Store we just created.

Run the following command:

```bash
$ plakar at $HOME/backups sync to "@s3-backups"
info: Synchronizing snapshot 772fba5f575272ba8742e63c6ec1878623900d158c5de4b20b854a0aa15a7b47 from fs:///Users/niluje/backups to s3://localhost:9000/mybucket
info: Synchronization of 772fba5f575272ba8742e63c6ec1878623900d158c5de4b20b854a0aa15a7b47 finished
info: sync: synchronization from fs:///Users/niluje/backups to s3://localhost:9000/mybucket completed: 1 snapshots synchronized
```

The command transfers all the snapshots from the local Kloset Store to the S3
Kloset Store.

To verify that the synchronization was successful, you can list the snapshots in
the S3 Kloset Store again:

```bash
$ plakar at "@s3-backups" ls
2025-12-15T21:09:32Z   772fba5f   2.9 MiB        0s /private/etc
```

Notice that the snapshot ID is the same as the one in the local Kloset Store,
confirming that the data has been successfully copied.

If you run the sync command again, you will see that no data is transferred
because the destination store already contains all the snapshots from the source
store.

```bash
$ plakar at $HOME/backups sync to "@s3-backups"
destination store passphrase:
info: sync: synchronization from fs:///Users/niluje/backups to s3://localhost:9000/mybucket completed: 0 snapshots synchronized
```

In production, you would typically run this command periodically to ensure that
the S3 Kloset Store remains up-to-date with the local Kloset Store. If there are
no new snapshots to transfer, the command will complete quickly without
transferring any data.

## A remote Kloset Store works just like a local one

As a side note, you can use the remote Kloset Store just as you would use the
local one:

- to run the UI, `plakar at "@s3-backups" ui`
- to verify integrity, `plakar at "@s3-backups" check`
- to restore files,
  `plakar at "@s3-backups" restore -to /tmp/restore <snapshot-id>`

Check `plakar help` to see all the available commands.

## Congratulations!

You have successfully created a second copy of your Kloset Store on
S3-compatible storage. Your backups are now stored in two independent locations.

In this example, we used a local MinIO instance for demonstration purposes. In a
real-world scenario, you would use a reliable S3-compatible service to have your
backups stored offsite.

With **Plakar**, hosting your backups on S3 is as easy as hosting them locally.
In addition, many more [store integrations](/integrations/) are available for
hosting your backups in other locations.

## Next steps

Modern infrastructure involves more than just filesystems. In the next part of
this Quickstart, we will see how to back up an S3 bucket using **plakar**.

- Continue to [Part 3 of the Quickstart](../backup-non-filesystem-data) to
  create a backup for your non-filesystem data.
