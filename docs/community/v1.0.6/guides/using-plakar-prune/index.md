# Pruning Snapshots

`plakar prune` removes snapshots from a Kloset store. Snapshots can be selected
for removal by age, tag, or retention policy.

Every backup you run creates a new snapshot in your Kloset store. If its feft
unchecked, snapshots can accumulate indefinitely.

Pruning lets you define how much history you actually need such as keeping
hourly snapshots for the past week, daily ones for the past month, monthly ones
for the past year and discard everything else. This keeps your store from
growing without bound while preserving important recovery points.

By default, `plakar prune` runs in dry-run mode and makes no changes, you'll
need to pass `-apply` to execute the operation.

On this guide, we will use a Kloset store is located at `$HOME/backups`, but
your store can be located anywhere else:

## Previewing what would be pruned

Before removing anything, check which snapshots would be affected:

```sh
$ plakar at $HOME/backups prune -days 30
```

No snapshots are deleted without `-apply`. The output shows what _would_ be
removed.

## Removing snapshots by age

To delete snapshots older than 30 days:

```sh
$ plakar at $HOME/backups prune -days 30 -apply
```

You can use other flags like `-weeks`, `-months`, or `-years` to specify age.

## Removing snapshots by tag

To delete snapshots older than 30 days that carry a specific tag:

```sh
$ plakar at $HOME/backups prune -days 30 -tag daily-backup -apply
```

Only snapshots matching the tag are considered. Others are left untouched.

## Applying a retention policy

A retention policy keeps a defined number of snapshots across different time
windows and deletes everything else. This is the most common way to keep a store
bounded over time.

```sh
$ plakar at $HOME/backups prune \
  -days 1 -per-day 7 \
  -weeks 4 -per-week 1 \
  -months 12 -per-month 1 \
  -years 5 -per-year 1 \
  -apply
```

This can be broken down as:

- `-days 1 -per-day 7` — For the past day, keep up to 7 snapshots. This
  preserves frequent checkpoints in the most recent period.
- `-weeks 4 -per-week 1` — For the past 4 weeks, keep 1 snapshot per week. Older
  intra-day snapshots are pruned down to a single representative per week.
- `-months 12 -per-month 1` — For the past 12 months, keep 1 snapshot per month.
- `-years 5 -per-year 1` — For the past 5 years, keep 1 snapshot per year.

Everything outside those windows is deleted.

## Using a named policy

Rather than specifying retention parameters on the command line each time, a
named policy can be defined once and reused.

You can create a policy and configure its retention parameters:

```sh
$ plakar policy add weekly
$ plakar policy set weekly since='3 months'
$ plakar policy set weekly per-week=1
```

Then apply the policy:

```sh
$ plakar at $HOME/backups prune -policy weekly -apply
```

### Managing policies

```sh
$ plakar policy show              # list all policies (YAML by default)
$ plakar policy show -json        # output as JSON
$ plakar policy show weekly       # inspect a specific policy
$ plakar policy set weekly per-week=2   # update a parameter
$ plakar policy unset weekly per-week   # remove a parameter
$ plakar policy rm weekly         # delete a policy
```

## Reclaiming storage after pruning

Pruning removes snapshots, but does not immediately free storage. Because Plakar
deduplicates data across snapshots, the underlying chunks and packfiles remain
until `plakar maintenance` runs (also consider the maintenance
[grace period](../../explanations/how-maintenance-works/#the-grace-period)).

After pruning, run `plakar maintenance` to reclaim the freed space:

```sh
$ plakar maintenance
```
