# Physical backups with pg_basebackup

`pg_basebackup` is the standard PostgreSQL utility used to perform **physical
backups** of a PostgreSQL cluster. Unlike SQL dumps, a physical backup captures
the entire data directory, allowing you to restore a PostgreSQL instance exactly
as it was at backup time, including configuration files and internal state.

For a deeper understanding of physical backups, replication, and base backups,
refer to the
[official PostgreSQL documentation on pg_basebackup](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgbasebackup.html).

## Requirements

This guide assumes that you have:

- A running PostgreSQL server configured to allow base backups.
- A PostgreSQL role with `REPLICATION` privileges.
- The environment variables `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, and `PGPASSWORD` set
  to connect to your PostgreSQL server.
- `pg_basebackup` available on the system where the backup is performed.

### pg_hba.conf configuration

Since `pg_basebackup` requires replication connections, ensure that your
`pg_hba.conf` file includes an entry allowing the backup user to connect for
replication. For example:

```bash
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   replication     all                                     trust
```

This entry allows local replication connections without a password and should
only be used in trusted environments.

Adapt the configuration to your needs and restart PostgreSQL after making
changes.

## Performing the backup

### Directory-based backup

`pg_basebackup` expects a directory where the database will be copied. This
directory can be stored with Plakar, like any other directory.

Run the following commands:

```bash
$ export PGUSER=xxx
$ export PGPORT=5432
$ export PGHOST=xxx
$ export PGPASSWORD=xxx

$ pg_basebackup -D ./database
$ plakar at /var/backups backup ./database
$ rm -rf ./database
```

This sequence of commands:

- Exports the necessary environment variables to connect to the PostgreSQL
  server.
- Runs `pg_basebackup`, storing the backup in a local directory named
  `./database`.
- Uses Plakar to back up the `./database` directory into the Kloset store at
  `/var/backups`.
- Removes the local backup directory to free up space.

With this method, WAL files are fetched as needed during the base backup
process.

## Tar-based backup

Alternatively, `pg_basebackup` can create a tarball. This tarball can be backed
up using the `tar` source importer of Plakar.

```bash
$ export PGUSER=xxx
$ export PGPORT=5432
$ export PGHOST=xxx
$ export PGPASSWORD=xxx

$ pg_basebackup -D - -F tar -X fetch > /tmp/pg_backup.tar
$ plakar at /var/backups backup tar:///tmp/pg_backup.tar
$ rm /tmp/pg_backup.tar
```

> This method may be slower than a directory-based backup as it requires
> serializing the data into a tarball. Ensure you have enough temporary disk
> space for the tarball before running the backup.

## Restoring a physical backup

To restore a physical backup created with `pg_basebackup`, use the
`plakar restore` command to extract the backup to a local directory.

```bash
$ plakar at /var/backups restore -to ./mydb 3bcb4fd8
```

This command restores the snapshot with ID `3bcb4fd8` from the Kloset store
located at `/var/backups` to a local directory named `./mydb`.

> This command is not PostgreSQL-specific. It works for any data stored in
> Plakar.

## Running PostgreSQL with Docker from a physical backup

With a physical backup, you can easily run a PostgreSQL instance using Docker,
provided the PostgreSQL version matches the one used to create the backup.

```bash
$ docker run --rm -ti --name pg -v ./mydb:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
```

This command starts a PostgreSQL container using the official `postgres` image,
mounting the restored backup directory `./mydb` as the data directory for
PostgreSQL.

Replace `postgres` with `postgres:<version>` to specify the desired PostgreSQL
version.

To connect to the running PostgreSQL instance, use:

```bash
$ docker exec -ti pg psql -U postgres -c '\l'
```

## Considerations

### Physical vs logical backups

SQL dumps (`pg_dump`, `pg_dumpall`) are logical backups, portable across
PostgreSQL versions and architectures.

`pg_basebackup` produces physical backups, which are faster to restore but must
be used with a compatible PostgreSQL version and system layout.

Choose the method that best fits your recovery and portability requirements.

### Read-only mounts

Plakar supports a FUSE filesystem that allows mounting a Kloset store as a
read-only filesystem.

PostgreSQL requires read-write access to its data directory, even for read-only
operations. Therefore, it is not possible to run PostgreSQL directly from a
read-only mount of a Kloset store.

### Kloset store location

In the examples above, we used `/var/backups` as the Kloset store location.

It is possible to use other store locations, for example to store the snapshots
in a cloud storage bucket. Check the guide
[Creating a Kloset Store](../../create-kloset-repository) for more information
on setting up Kloset stores.
