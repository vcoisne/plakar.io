# Importing Configurations

The commands `plakar store`, `plakar source` and `plakar destination` configure
storage locations, backup sources, and restore destinations respectively.

Each command includes an import subcommand for importing configurations from
different sources.

## Why you'd need to import configurations

Plakar stores, sources, and destinations each require configuration data such as
credentials, locations and passphrases that you'd otherwise have to re-enter
manually on every machine.

Importing lets you replicate a working setup across servers, share
configurations across a team, migrate from one machine to another, or bootstrap
a new installation from a backup of your config.

It also lets you bring in configurations from other tools directly: if you
already have rclone remotes configured, you can import them as Plakar stores
without duplicating the credentials by hand.

## Basic Usage

The import subcommand can read configuration data from:

- Standard input (stdin) — useful for piping from other commands
- A file specified with the `-config` option
- URLs (when using `-config` with a URL)

### Importing from a Configuration File

Use the `-config` option to specify a configuration file to import. Create a
YAML file with the appropriate structure for the type of configuration you're
importing.

For example, to import store configurations, create a file like
`my-stores.yaml`:

```yaml
minio:
  access_key: minioadmin
  location: s3://localhost:9000/kloset
  passphrase: superpassphrase
  secret_access_key: minioadmin
  use_tls: "false"
```

Then import it with:

```bash
$ plakar store import -config my-stores.yaml
```

Similarly for sources and destinations:

```bash
$ plakar source import -config my-sources.yaml
$ plakar destination import -config my-destinations.yaml
```

The configuration files should be in YAML format with named sections for each
configuration entry.

### Importing from Piped Input

You can pipe configuration data directly from other commands:

```bash
# Import a specific source configuration as a destination
$ plakar source show -secrets | plakar destination import mybucket

# Import all sources as destinations
$ plakar source show -secrets | plakar destination import

# Import from rclone configuration
$ rclone config show -secrets | plakar store import -rclone koofr
```

### Section Selection

You can specify which sections to import by listing their names. Sections can be
renamed during import by appending `:newname`.

```bash
# Import only specific sections
$ plakar store import -config stores.yaml section1 section2

# Import and rename sections
$ plakar store import -config stores.yaml oldname:newname
```

## Configuration File Format

Configuration files should be in YAML format. Each top-level key represents a
named configuration section.

### Store Configuration Example

```yaml
mystorage:
  location: s3://mybucket
  access_key: myaccesskey
  secret_access_key: mysecretkey

localbackup:
  location: /var/backups
```

### Source Configuration Example

```yaml
myapp:
  location: /var/www/myapp
  excludes: "*.log,*.tmp"

database:
  location: postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mydb
```

### Destination Configuration Example

```yaml
restorepoint:
  location: /mnt/restore
  permissions: 0755

cloudrestore:
  location: s3://restore-bucket
  access_key: restorekey
  secret_access_key: restoresecret
```

## Practical Examples

### Migrating from rclone

If you have rclone configurations, you can easily import them as Plakar stores:

```bash
# Show available rclone remotes
$ rclone config show

# Import a specific rclone remote as a Plakar store
$ rclone config show | plakar store import -rclone myremote
```

### Bulk Configuration Management

You can export and import configurations between different Plakar installations:

```bash
# Export current store configurations
$ plakar store show -secrets > stores-backup.yaml

# Import on another machine
$ plakar store import -config stores-backup.yaml
```

### Converting Sources to Destinations

A common use case is to use the same locations for both backup sources and
restore destinations:

```bash
# Import all sources as destinations
$ plakar source show -secrets | plakar destination import

# Import a specific source as a destination with a new name
$ plakar source show -secrets | plakar destination import mysource:myrestore
```

### Verification

After importing, verify the configuration was imported correctly:

```bash
$ plakar store show
$ plakar source show
$ plakar destination show
```

Use the `check` subcommand to validate configurations:

```bash
$ plakar store check mystore
$ plakar source check mysource
$ plakar destination check mydest
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure you have read access to the configuration file
   and write access to Plakar's configuration directory.
2. **Invalid YAML**: Validate your YAML syntax before importing. Use tools like
   `yamllint` or online validators.
3. **Name Conflicts**: Use `-overwrite` to replace existing configurations, or
   rename sections during import.
4. **rclone Import Issues**: Ensure rclone is installed and the specified remote
   exists in your rclone configuration.
