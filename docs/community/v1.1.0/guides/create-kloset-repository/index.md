# Creating a Kloset Store

A Kloset store is Plakar's immutable storage backend for backup data. This guide
covers filesystem-based store creation. You can learn more in the
[Kloset deep dive article](https://www.plakar.io/posts/2025-04-29/kloset-the-immutable-data-store/).

## Why you need a Kloset store

Before you can run any backup, you'll need to create a Kloset store to hold the
data. It can be hosted anywhere that Plakar has an integration with a
[storage connector](/integrations/?category=storage). For example, a local
filesystem path, a remote S3 bucket, another server via SFTP, or other supported
backends.

## Create a store with a path

```bash
$ plakar at /var/backups create
```

Plakar prompts for an encryption passphrase. To avoid the prompt, set:

```bash
$ export PLAKAR_PASSPHRASE="my-secret-passphrase"
$ plakar at /var/backups create
```

Plakar encrypts the store by default. A few flags modify this behaviour:

- `-keyfile <path>`: reads the passphrase from a file, taking precedence over
  the environment variable. Useful when a file-based secret is preferred over an
  environment variable for non-interactive services.
- `-weak-passphrase`: allows a weak passphrase to be accepted (avoid in
  production).

## Default store location

Without specifying a path, `plakar create` uses `~/.plakar`:

```bash
$ plakar create
```

## Create a store with an alias

Configure a store once, then reference it by alias in all subsequent commands:

```bash
$ plakar store add mybackups /var/backups passphrase=xxx
```

Use the configured store:

```bash
$ plakar at @mybackups create
$ plakar at @mybackups ls
```

## HTTP and HTTPS stores

A store exposed over the network with `plakar server` is reached using an
`http://` or `https://` location. See
[Serving a Kloset Store over the Network](../../guides/serving-a-kloset-store-over-the-network)
for how to expose one.

These locations accept additional options, configured like any other store
option:

```bash
$ plakar store add remote https://backup.example.com auth_token=xxx
```

- `auth_token`: bearer token sent in the `Authorization` header on every
  request. Required when the server was started with `-token`.
- `insecure`: set to `true` to allow `auth_token` to be sent over a plaintext
  HTTP connection. Without it, the token is only sent over HTTPS.
- `timeout`: per-request timeout. Defaults to `5m`.
- `tls_no_verify`: set to `true` to disable TLS certificate verification. Useful
  when the server uses a self-signed certificate.

## Override a store path at runtime

When using a config alias, you can override the root path of the store without
changing the stored configuration. This is useful when the alias points to a
base location and you want to target a subdirectory or an entirely different
path for a specific operation.

Given an alias `foobar` configured as `sftp://localhost/tmp`:

```bash
# Use the configured root as-is
$ plakar at @foobar

# Append a relative subdirectory: resolves to sftp://localhost/tmp/etc
$ plakar at @foobar:etc

# Override with an absolute path: resolves to sftp://localhost/etc
$ plakar at @foobar:/etc
```

The same override syntax applies when specifying a **backup source**. Given an
alias `foobar` configured as `sftp://localhost/etc`:

```bash
# Use the configured source root
$ plakar backup @foobar

# Append a relative path: resolves to sftp://localhost/etc/uucp
$ plakar backup @foobar:uucp

# Override with an absolute path: resolves to sftp://localhost/etc/uucp
$ plakar backup @foobar:/etc/uucp
```

## Back up multiple directories

You can back up more than one directory in a single snapshot by passing multiple
paths to `plakar backup`:

```bash
$ plakar backup /etc /home
```

> [!NOTE]+ Cross-connector sources
>
> Currently, multi-directory backup requires all sources to use the same
> connector. Support for combining sources across connectors (e.g. a local path
> alongside an S3 connector) is still in development.

## Update store configuration

```bash
$ plakar store set mybackups passphrase=yyy
```

> [!WARNING]+ Passphrase changes
>
> Updating the passphrase only affects the configuration. Existing data created
> with the old passphrase requires the original passphrase to access.

## When to use aliases

Use aliases for:

- Stores requiring credentials (S3, cloud storage)
- Multiple stores with different configurations
- Avoiding repetitive path specifications

## Why the repository may appear larger than the data

In a small test environment, the repository size can exceed the size of the
saved data. For example, 8.9 MB for the repository against 3 MB of source data.
This is because Plakar has a fixed structural overhead of roughly 5–6 MB (index,
state, and packfile structures) that dominates when the data volume is small.
The gains from deduplication and compression only become apparent at scale, on
real repetitive data with a history of multiple snapshots. A toy folder is not a
representative benchmark.
