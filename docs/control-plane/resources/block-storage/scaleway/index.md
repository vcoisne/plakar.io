# Scaleway Block Storage

Scaleway block storage resources represent persistent block volumes managed by
Scaleway. Plakar Control Plane backs up block storages by triggering a Scaleway
snapshot export, which saves the volume as a QCOW2 image to a Scaleway Object
Storage bucket. Plakar Control Plane then backs up that image into the Kloset
store.

During restore, Plakar Control Plane uploads the QCOW2 image back to the bucket
and uses it to recreate the block volume.

A dedicated Scaleway Object Storage bucket is required for this process. Plakar
Control Plane uses this bucket as a temporary staging area when exporting and
restoring block volume snapshots. We recommend creating a bucket specifically
for this purpose, as it is also used when backing up other Scaleway resources
such as instances.

## Configuration

Scaleway block storage resources can be configured using a source or destination
app.

### Integration

Automatically set to the Scaleway integration for any resource with `class`
Block Storage managed by a Scaleway inventory.

### Access Key and Secret Key

The access key and secret key used to authenticate with Scaleway. See the
documentation on
[Managing IAM Policies and API Keys on Scaleway](../../../guides/scaleway/iam-and-api-keys)
for instructions on how to set up the permissions and generate an access key and
secret key.

### Bucket

The Scaleway Object Storage bucket name. Used as a temporary staging area when
exporting block storage snapshots. This bucket must exist before configuring the
resource. We recommend using a dedicated bucket for Plakar Control Plane
operations rather than a general-purpose bucket.

## Additional configuration

### Source

**Environment**

Optional. The SLA environment covering this source, for example production,
staging, or development. See the
[policies documentation](../../../operations/policies) for more details.

**Data Class**

Optional. The SLA data class covering this source, for example critical,
database, or PII. See the [policies documentation](../../../operations/policies)
for more details.

## Permissions

Plakar Control Plane requires a set of IAM permissions on your Scaleway project
to access block volumes and the staging Object Storage bucket. These permissions
should be attached to an IAM application that Plakar Control Plane will use to
authenticate. See the documentation on
[Managing IAM Policies and API Keys on Scaleway](../../../guides/scaleway/iam-and-api-keys)
for instructions on how to set up the permissions and generate an access key and
secret key.
