# Email & SMTP Setup

Plakar Control Plane can send email notifications using an `SMTP` server. This
is configured per organization, from the
[organization settings](../settings/organization#smtp).

Provide the hostname, port, authentication credentials (if required), and the
sender email address that should appear in outgoing messages. If your SMTP
server supports encrypted connections, enable **TLS** to secure communication
between Plakar Control Plane and the mail server.

Once configured, this SMTP server is used for the emails sent on behalf of the
organization it was configured for. The initial enrollment email used during
first-time setup is an exception, because it is sent before an SMTP server can
be configured.
