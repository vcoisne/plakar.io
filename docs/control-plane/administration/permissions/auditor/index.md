# Auditor

The **Auditor** reads everything and changes nothing. Every permission in the
organization family and every resource class is held at the view level, so an
**Auditor** can inspect the organization, its members, its audit log, and all of
its resources without being able to alter any of them. It holds nothing in the
deployment family.

It fits review and compliance work, where the requirement is to inspect the
state of an organization rather than change it.
