# Superuser

The **Superuser** is the admin account created when the instance is first set
up, either during [enrollment](../../../intro/enrollment#admin-account) or
during
[air-gapped enrollment](../../../intro/air-gapped#organization-and-admin-account)
on instances without outbound connectivity.

It holds full access to every permission in all three families. Its resource
access is not restricted to a subset, it covers every resource of every class in
the organization.

The **Superuser** reaches the deployment family, which is what allows it to
change [Control Plane settings](../../settings/control-plane) and manage the
license. Because the instance belongs to no organization, that access extends to
every organization hosted on it.

The [Platform Admin](../platform-admin) holds that same deployment access and
nothing else. It maintains the instance and administers no organization, which
is what separates it from the **Superuser**.
