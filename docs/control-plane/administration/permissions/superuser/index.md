# Superuser

The **Superuser** is the admin account created when the instance is first set
up, either during [enrollment](../../../intro/enrollment#admin-account) or
during
[air-gapped enrollment](../../../intro/air-gapped#organization-and-admin-account)
on instances without outbound connectivity.

It holds full access to every permission in all three families. Its resource
access is not restricted to a subset, it covers every resource of every class in
the organization.

The **Superuser** is the only role that reaches the deployment family. Because
the instance belongs to no organization, that access extends to every
organization hosted on it, and it is what allows the **Superuser** to change
[Control Plane settings](../../settings/control-plane) and manage the license.
