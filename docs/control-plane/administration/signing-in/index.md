# Signing In

Signing in to Plakar Control Plane requires an account and a password. The
account identifies who you are and which organization you are signing in to.

Users are identified by their email address, and that identity is shared across
the entire deployment. Because the same user can be a member of several
organizations, the account you enter also selects the
[organization context](../organizations#organization-context) you want to login
to.

## Signing in to the root organization

To sign in to the root organization, enter your email address on its own:

```text
chunky@ptarson.io
```

## Signing in to a specific organization

To sign in to any other organization, prefix your email address with the
organization's short identifier, separated by a slash:

```text
7d450d1e/chunky@ptarson.io
```

Organizations are identified internally by a UUID, but signing in uses the short
identifier, not the full UUID. An organization's short identifier is shown under
[Settings -> Organizations](../settings/organization) as well as when a member
is added to an organization.

The password is the same in both cases. The prefix selects the organization, not
a different account.

## Switching organizations

The organization is selected at sign-in and applies for the rest of the session.
To work in a different organization, sign out and sign in again using that
organization's short identifier.

## Access requirements

You can only sign in to an organization you are a member of. A user who is not a
member of any organization cannot sign in until they are added to one. See
[Managing Users](../users) for information about organization membership.

The first time a user signs in with a generated password, they are required to
set a new password before they can continue.

If two-factor authentication is enabled on the account, a verification code is
requested after the password. See
[Two-factor authentication](../two-factor-authentication) for details.

If the organization
[requires two-factor authentication](../settings/organization#two-factor-authentication)
for all of its members, members without an enrolled second factor must set one
up the next time they sign in. They must complete enrollment before they can
access Plakar Control Plane. If a password change is also required, such as
during a user's first sign-in, the second-factor enrollment is completed before
the password change.
