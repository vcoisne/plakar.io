# Managing IAM Roles and Service Accounts

Plakar Control Plane requires permissions to access Google Cloud services in
different situations. For example, when using Google Cloud Storage, Plakar
Control Plane needs permission to read from and write to buckets. Credentials
are also used by
[Google Cloud Inventory](../../../infrastructure/inventories/google-cloud) to
discover resources in your project, and by integrations to manage different
resources.

In Google Cloud, access is managed through IAM roles assigned to service
accounts. A custom role defines the exact permissions granted, and a service
account acts as the identity that holds that role. A service account key is then
generated and used by external services such as Plakar Control Plane to
authenticate against Google Cloud APIs.

Plakar Control Plane can authenticate to Google Cloud in two ways:

- **Service account key:** a JSON key generated for the service account and
  provided to Plakar Control Plane. This works wherever Plakar Control Plane
  runs, including outside Google Cloud.
- **Attached service account:** when Plakar Control Plane runs on a Compute
  Engine instance, the service account can be attached to the instance itself.
  Plakar Control Plane then obtains credentials from the instance, and no key
  needs to be generated, stored, or rotated.

This guide walks through creating a custom IAM role, creating a service account,
and assigning the role to it. It then covers both ways of using the service
account: generating a key, or attaching it to the Plakar Control Plane instance.

## Creating a Custom Role

The first step is to create a custom IAM role with the permissions required by
the Google Cloud service you want Plakar to use.

The exact permissions depend on the feature you are configuring. For example,
the [Google Cloud inventory](../../../infrastructure/inventories/google-cloud)
documentation lists the permissions required to discover Google Cloud resources,
while the [GCS resource](../../../resources/object-storage/gcs) documentation
lists the permissions required to use a Cloud Storage bucket as a source, store,
or destination.

To create a custom role, open **IAM & Admin > Roles** in the Google Cloud
Console and click **Create Custom Role** under the **Custom** roles tab. Provide
a name and description for the role. You'll also need to select a role launch
stage. The launch stage indicates the maturity of the role and is for
organizational tracking purposes only, it does not affect what the role can do.
For a role used with Plakar Control Plane, select **General Availability**. Then
add the required permissions. You can search for permissions by name to find the
ones you need.

After adding the required permissions, click **Create** to save the role.

## Creating a Service Account

After creating the custom role, create a service account to act as the identity
Plakar Control Plane will use when accessing Google Cloud services.

To create a service account, open **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts** in the
Google Cloud Console and click **Create Service Account**. Provide a name and
description for the service account, then click **Create and Continue**.

{{< figure src="../images/creating-service-account.png" class="mx-auto max-w-100" >}}

On the next step, assign the custom role created in the previous step to the
service account. Click **Select a role**, then under **Custom** you can find the
custom role we created before.

Click **Done** to finish creating the service account.

## Generating a Service Account Key

A key is only required when the service account is not attached to the Plakar
Control Plane instance. If you are using an attached service account, skip to
[Attaching the Service Account to an Instance](#attaching-the-service-account-to-an-instance).

After creating the service account and assigning the role, generate a key for
the service account. This key is what Plakar Control Plane uses to authenticate
with Google Cloud APIs.

To generate a key, open the service account details page by clicking on the
service account in **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**. Go to the **Keys** tab
and click **Add Key > Create new key**.

Select **JSON** as the key type and click **Create**. Google Cloud will generate
the key and download it to your machine as a JSON file.

> [!WARNING]+
>
> The JSON key file is only available at the time of creation. Store it securely
> before leaving the page, and treat it as you would any other sensitive
> credential.

## Attaching the Service Account to an Instance

When Plakar Control Plane runs on a Compute Engine instance, the service account
can be attached to the instance instead of using a key. Credentials are then
issued by the instance and refreshed automatically.

Access from an attached service account is limited by two independent controls:

- **IAM roles:** the permissions granted to the service account, such as the
  custom role created above.
- **Access scopes:** a per-instance setting that restricts which Google Cloud
  APIs the instance's credentials can be used for.

A request succeeds only if both allow it. The default access scopes do not
include every API Plakar Control Plane uses. For example, Secret Manager is not
included. With the default scopes, requests fail with a permission error even
when the IAM role grants the required permissions. Set the access scope to
`cloud-platform`, which allows all APIs, and use IAM roles to control what the
service account can actually do.

The service account and access scopes can be set when the instance is created,
as described in the
[Google Cloud installation](../../../intro/installation/google-cloud) guide. To
change them on an existing instance, the instance must be stopped first:

```bash
gcloud compute instances stop <INSTANCE_NAME> --zone=<ZONE>
gcloud compute instances set-service-account <INSTANCE_NAME> \
  --zone=<ZONE> \
  --service-account=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> \
  --scopes=cloud-platform
gcloud compute instances start <INSTANCE_NAME> --zone=<ZONE>
```

Access scopes only apply to credentials issued by the instance. When a service
account key is provided, the key's credentials are used instead and access
scopes have no effect.
