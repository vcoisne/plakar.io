## Why protecting MinIO matters

Object storage is often perceived as durable by default, but durability is not
the same as a backup. Many organizations use MinIO to store logs, datasets,
container images, or even other backup files, assuming they are safe.

However, without independent immutability and integrity validation, data stored
in MinIO is still vulnerable to:

- **Silent Corruption**: Data can degrade over time without being noticed.
- **Accidental Deletion**: Misconfigured lifecycle policies can delete important
  data automatically.
- **Access Mismanagement**: If security keys are leaked or misused, your entire
  data store can be wiped or altered.

When retention and recovery are mission-critical, simply storing objects is not
enough. You need a verifiable backup strategy.

## Security and Compromise

MinIO relies on access and secret keys for authentication. Because these keys
are often shared across different services or scripts, they represent a
significant security risk. If these credentials are compromised:

- **Total Loss**: Attackers can delete or overwrite entire buckets.
- **Automated Damage**: Malicious changes can be replicated instantly across
  your environment.
- **No Recovery**: Unless an independent backup exists, there is no way to
  "undo" a deletion in a standard object store.

Plakar mitigates this risk by providing immutable snapshots stored outside the
standard MinIO access scope and end-to-end encrypted so it keeps your data
private even if the storage backend is accessed by an unauthorized party.

Plakar also allows for direct inspection of backups, you can easily browse,
search, or verify the integrity of your data via the CLI or UI without needing
to perform a full restore first.

## How Plakar secures your MinIO workflows

Plakar integrates with MinIO as a flexible bridge, allowing you to move data
securely in either direction:

- **Source Connector**: Take snapshots of one or multiple MinIO buckets. Plakar
  encrypts and deduplicates the content before saving it to a trusted Kloset
  store.
- **Destination Connector**: Restore verified snapshots back into MinIO, whether
  on-premise or in the cloud, in a format that matches your original
  environment.

## Use MinIO as your Backup Vault

MinIO is also a powerful destination for your Plakar snapshots. By using MinIO
as a Kloset storage backend, you can store encrypted, deduplicated, and
versioned backups from any source:

- **Databases**: Secure your PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB exports.
- **Systems**: Backup file systems from servers, workstations, or NAS devices.
- **Applications**: Store exports from containers or cloud applications.

Plakar uses deduplication which significantly reduces the amount of storage
space and bandwidth needed as your MinIO-based backup library grows.

Plakar ensures that MinIO works as both a secure source and a trusted storage
backend for your entire infrastructure.
