## Why protecting Google Cloud Storage data matters

GCS is often used as a backup destination, but infrastructure durability is not
the same as data protection. While Google provides strong redundancy at the
storage level, your data remains logically vulnerable to:

- **Accidental Deletion**: Misconfigured lifecycle policies or bulk delete
  operations can permanently remove critical objects in seconds. GCS does not
  provide a safety net for logical deletions unless object versioning is
  explicitly enabled and maintained.
- **Silent Corruption**: Standard object storage lacks built-in integrity
  validation across your entire dataset. Objects can be overwritten or corrupted
  without any automatic detection.
- **Versioning Gaps**: Object versioning is optional and easy to misconfigure.
  Even when enabled, it does not protect against lifecycle policy deletions or
  deliberate version purging.
- **Replication Risks**: GCS replication spreads corruption, accidental
  deletions, and malicious changes just as quickly as legitimate data.

For production data, compliance records, and cloud-native assets, Google Cloud
Storage needs an independent safety net beyond buckets and replication.

## What happens when GCP credentials are compromised

Access to GCS is controlled by service account keys, IAM roles, and application
default credentials. These credentials are frequently embedded in application
configuration, CI/CD pipelines, or shared across services, creating significant
exposure.

If credentials are leaked or permissions are misconfigured:

- **Total Loss**: An attacker with sufficient IAM permissions can delete or
  overwrite entire buckets through the API. Automated scripts can wipe thousands
  of objects in seconds.
- **Ransomware Encryption**: Malicious actors can overwrite all objects with
  encrypted content, making your data inaccessible without paying a ransom.
- **Damage Propagation**: Replication and sync jobs immediately propagate
  malicious changes across regions, amplifying the impact.
- **No Recovery Path**: Without an independent backup, there is no way to undo
  deletions or modifications in standard GCS.

Plakar mitigates these risks by creating immutable snapshots stored outside the
live GCS namespace. With end-to-end encryption and support for offline or
air-gapped retention, your backups remain secure even if your GCP credentials
are compromised.

## How Plakar secures your Google Cloud Storage workflows

Plakar integrates with Google Cloud Storage as a flexible bridge, enabling
secure data movement in multiple directions:

- **Source Connector**: Take snapshots of one or more GCS buckets. Plakar
  encrypts and deduplicates the content before saving it to a trusted Kloset
  Store, creating an independent backup layer outside GCP.
- **Storage Connector**: Use GCS as your Kloset backend. Store encrypted,
  deduplicated, and versioned snapshots from any source — databases, file
  systems, containers, or other cloud services.
- **Destination Connector**: Restore verified snapshots back into GCS, whether
  to the original bucket, a different project, or an entirely separate region.

This enables multiple backup strategies:

- Pull data from production buckets into isolated backup storage
- Push encrypted snapshots to GCS as a low-cost, durable backend
- Separate backup credentials from production IAM roles for improved security

Plakar also allows direct inspection of backups. You can browse, search, or
verify the integrity of your GCS data via the CLI or UI without performing a
full restore first.

Instead of relying solely on GCP configuration and access controls, Plakar
provides cryptographic guarantees and operational control over your data — from
snapshot creation through integrity verification to recovery.
