## Why use Streams instead of Files

Plakar’s Stdio integration can back up any data stream provided via stdin like
database dumps, system logs, command output or custom scripts. Unlike workflows
that first create intermediate files, streaming data directly avoids several
challenges:

- **Storage Waste**: You need enough free space to hold the uncompressed export
  before it even gets to your backup tool.
- **Security Risks**: Temporary files often sit on your disk unencrypted while
  waiting to be backed up.
- **Complexity**: You have to manage the creation and deletion of these
  intermediate files.

With the Stdio integration, Plakar reads data as it’s generated, encrypts and
deduplicates it, and streams it straight to your Kloset Store without creating
any intermediate files on disk.

## Automation with Stdio

Stdio is useful for administrators and power users building automated backups
while avoiding temporary files. Data from scripts, commands, or applications can
be backed up directly.

When recovery is needed, streams can be fed back into databases, tools, or
terminals immediately, with full integrity verification. You can also inspect,
browse, and search backups via the CLI or UI without performing a full restore
first.

## How Plakar handles your data streams

Plakar handles live data directly:

- **Source Connector**: Capture output from any command or script and save it as
  a named object in a snapshot in Kloset.
- **Destination Connector**: Stream your saved data back into any tool or
  display it directly in your terminal without writing a file to disk first.

## Common Questions

**1. What kind of data can I back up this way?**  
Anything that produces text or binary output, such as database dumps, system
logs, or diagnostic scripts.

**2. Do I need to name the stream?**  
Yes. Streams don’t have filenames, so you assign a name to identify and retrieve
them later.

**3. Can I pipe a backup directly into another program?**  
Yes. You can restore a specific object from a snapshot and feed it directly into
a tool like a database importer for fast recovery.
