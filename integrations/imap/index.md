## Why protecting IMAP matters

Email is often treated as inherently persistent, but IMAP mailboxes are
vulnerable to both accidental and malicious data loss. Standard IMAP setups face
several critical risks:

- **Accidental Deletion**: Users can permanently delete entire folders with a
  few clicks. Most mail clients offer no meaningful undo beyond a trash folder
  that itself can be emptied.
- **Account Compromise**: If credentials are stolen or phished, attackers can
  delete years of correspondence instantly. Business email compromise attacks
  specifically target mailboxes to destroy evidence or communication history.
- **Retention Policy Gaps**: Server-side policies may automatically delete old
  messages. Quota pressures can force users to delete important emails. These
  deletions happen silently and often without adequate warning.
- **Synchronization Cascades**: IMAP synchronizes deletions across all connected
  devices immediately. A mistake on one device propagates everywhere, leaving no
  local copy to recover from.
- **No Version History**: Unlike documents or files, emails have no built-in
  versioning. Once modified or deleted on the server, the original is gone
  unless you have an independent backup.

Emails often contain business records, compliance data, legal correspondence, or
irreplaceable personal history and relying solely on the mail server is not
enough. You need verifiable, immutable snapshots that exist independently of
your IMAP account.

## Security and Compromise

IMAP access is controlled by usernames and passwords or, in some cases, OAuth
tokens. These credentials are frequently the target of phishing attacks,
credential stuffing, or social engineering.

If an IMAP account is compromised:

- **Total Mailbox Wipe**: Attackers can delete all messages, folders, and
  archived mail in seconds through any IMAP client or automated script.
- **Evidence Destruction**: Business email compromise (BEC) attackers
  specifically delete sent mail and correspondence to cover their tracks after
  fraudulent transactions.
- **Ransomware Encryption**: While less common than file encryption, some
  attacks target cloud-stored email, making messages inaccessible without
  payment.
- **No Server-Side Recovery**: Most mail providers offer limited or no recovery
  options for bulk deletions. Even when recovery exists, it is often
  time-limited (7-30 days) and may not restore folder structures or all
  metadata.
- **Compliance Violations**: For organizations subject to regulatory
  requirements, the loss of email records can result in significant legal and
  financial consequences.

Plakar mitigates these risks by creating immutable snapshots outside the live
IMAP scope. With end-to-end encryption, your backed-up emails remain private and
secure even if your mail server or storage backend is accessed by unauthorized
parties.

## How Plakar secures your IMAP workflows

Plakar integrates with any IMAP-compatible mail server as a flexible backup and
recovery solution:

- **Source Connector**: Backup mailboxes from any IMAP server. Plakar encrypts
  and deduplicates mail content and saves it to a secure Kloset Store, creating
  an independent backup layer that survives account compromise or server
  failures.
- **Destination Connector**: Restore snapshots back into any IMAP mailbox,
  whether to your original account, a different mail server, or a fresh mailbox
  for migration purposes.

This enables multiple backup and recovery strategies:

- Protect corporate mailboxes from accidental deletion or malicious attacks
- Archive compliance-critical email outside your production mail infrastructure
- Migrate mailboxes between providers while preserving complete history
- Maintain air-gapped copies of sensitive correspondence
- Separate backup credentials from production email access for improved security

Plakar works with any IMAP-compatible server, including Gmail, Office 365,
Exchange, Dovecot, Zimbra, and self-hosted mail systems.

Plakar also allows direct inspection of email backups. You can browse, search,
or verify the integrity of your mailbox snapshots via the CLI or UI without
needing to perform a full restore first, saving time and avoiding disruption to
your live mail environment.
