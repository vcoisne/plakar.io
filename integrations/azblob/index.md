## Why protecting Azure Blob Storage data matters

Azure Blob Storage is often used as a backup destination, but infrastructure
durability is not the same as data protection. While Azure provides strong
redundancy at the storage level, your data remains logically vulnerable to:

- **Accidental Deletion**: Misconfigured lifecycle policies or bulk delete
  operations can permanently remove critical blobs in seconds. Azure does not
  provide a safety net for logical deletions unless soft delete is explicitly
  enabled and configured correctly.
- **Silent Corruption**: Standard object storage lacks built-in integrity
  validation across your entire dataset. Data can be overwritten or corrupted
  without any automatic detection.
- **Versioning Gaps**: Blob versioning is optional and easy to misconfigure.
  Even when enabled, it does not protect against lifecycle policy deletions or
  deliberate version purging.
- **Replication Risks**: Azure replication spreads corruption, accidental
  deletions, and malicious changes just as quickly as legitimate data.

For production data, compliance records, and cloud-native assets, Azure Blob
Storage needs an independent safety net beyond containers and replication.

## What happens when Azure credentials are compromised

Access to Azure Blob Storage is controlled by storage account keys, connection
strings, and RBAC roles. These credentials are frequently embedded in
application configuration, CI/CD pipelines, or shared across services, creating
significant exposure.

If credentials are leaked or permissions are misconfigured:

- **Total Loss**: An attacker with a valid storage account key has full access
  to every container in the account. Automated scripts can delete or overwrite
  entire containers in seconds.
- **Ransomware Encryption**: Malicious actors can overwrite all blobs with
  encrypted content, making your data inaccessible without paying a ransom.
- **Damage Propagation**: Replication and sync jobs immediately propagate
  malicious changes across regions, amplifying the impact.
- **No Recovery Path**: Without an independent backup, there is no way to undo
  deletions or modifications in standard Azure Blob Storage.

Plakar mitigates these risks by creating immutable snapshots stored outside the
live Azure namespace. With end-to-end encryption and support for offline or
air-gapped retention, your backups remain secure even if your Azure credentials
are compromised.

## How Plakar secures your Azure Blob Storage workflows

Plakar integrates with Azure Blob Storage as a flexible bridge, enabling secure
data movement in multiple directions:

- **Source Connector**: Take snapshots of one or more Azure Blob containers.
  Plakar encrypts and deduplicates the content before saving it to a trusted
  Kloset Store, creating an independent backup layer outside Azure.
- **Storage Connector**: Use Azure Blob Storage as your Kloset backend. Store
  encrypted, deduplicated, and versioned snapshots from any source — databases,
  file systems, containers, or other cloud services.
- **Destination Connector**: Restore verified snapshots back into Azure Blob
  Storage, whether to the original container, a different storage account, or an
  entirely separate region.

This enables multiple backup strategies:

- Pull data from production containers into isolated backup storage
- Push encrypted snapshots to Azure as a low-cost, durable backend
- Separate backup credentials from production access for improved security

Plakar also allows direct inspection of backups. You can browse, search, or
verify the integrity of your Azure Blob data via the CLI or UI without
performing a full restore first.
