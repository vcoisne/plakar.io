## Why protecting Proton Drive matters

Proton Drive provides strong privacy through end-to-end encryption, but like any
cloud storage platform, it faces risks from accidental deletion, device
compromise, and sync propagation:

- **Instant Deletion**: If you or a collaborator accidentally delete a folder,
  that deletion spreads to every synced device immediately.
- **Limited Recovery Window**: Proton Drive provides a trash retention period,
  but if data loss is discovered after that window closes, those files may be
  permanently gone.
- **Ransomware**: If your local files are encrypted by malware, Proton Drive
  will sync those corrupted versions, overwriting your healthy data in the
  cloud.

For important documents and sensitive files, an independent backup provides an
additional safety layer that remains available regardless of what happens in
your live Proton Drive environment.

## Security and Compromise

Cloud storage accounts can be compromised through credential leaks, phishing, or
device theft. When an account is accessed without authorization:

- **Mass Deletion**: Unauthorized access can result in the deletion of files
  across all synced devices.
- **Synchronization Issues**: Malicious or accidental changes replicate
  instantly across your environment.
- **Limited Recovery Options**: Once the trash retention period expires,
  recovery becomes difficult or impossible.

Plakar creates immutable snapshots that exist outside your Proton Drive sync
scope. These backups are encrypted and remain intact even if your Proton Drive
account is compromised.

## How Plakar secures your Proton Drive workflows

Plakar integrates with Proton Drive as a flexible bridge for your data:

- **Source Connector**: Take snapshots of your Proton Drive data and store them
  in a secure Kloset Store.
- **Storage Connector**: Use Proton Drive as storage for your encrypted and
  deduplicated Plakar backups from other sources.
- **Destination Connector**: Restore verified snapshots directly back to your
  Proton Drive account when needed.

Plakar uses deduplication to minimize storage space and bandwidth usage while
preserving full snapshot history.
