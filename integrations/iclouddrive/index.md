## Why protecting iCloud Drive matters

iCloud Drive is central to the Apple ecosystem, seamlessly syncing files across
devices, however synchronization doesn't count as a backup solution. Actions
taken in iCloud Drive are synced to all connected devices almost instantly. This
leaves it vulnerable to:

- **Accidental Deletion**: Files removed by a user are quickly removed across
  all devices.
- **Overwrites and Corruption**: Bad edits or corrupted files replace healthy
  versions across the entire environment.
- **Ransomware**: Malware-encrypted files are synchronized back to iCloud Drive,
  overwriting clean data.

Native retention and recovery options are limited in scope and duration. While
Apple provides some version history, it's restricted to recent changes and
specific file types. For business-critical or compliance-sensitive data, an
independent and immutable backup history is essential.

## Security and compromise

Access to iCloud Drive is tied to Apple ID credentials, two-factor
authentication, and connected devices. If any of these are compromised:

- Mass data loss can occur within minutes
- Malicious changes are synchronized automatically across all devices
- Recovery windows may be limited or unavailable

Plakar mitigates these risks by creating immutable snapshots of your data that
cannot be altered. Backups are end-to-end encrypted, with keys that you own,
ensuring privacy and control even if your Apple ID itself is compromised.

## How Plakar secures your iCloud Drive workflows

Plakar integrates with iCloud Drive as a flexible bridge for your data:

- **Source Connector**: Take snapshots of your iCloud Drive files and store them
  in a secure Kloset Store.
- **Storage Connector**: Use iCloud Drive as a vault to store encrypted and
  deduplicated Plakar backups from other sources.
- **Destination Connector**: Restore verified snapshots directly back into
  iCloud Drive when needed.

Plakar uses deduplication to minimize storage space and bandwidth usage while
preserving full snapshot history. It also allows for direct inspection of
backups, letting you browse, search, and verify file content via the CLI or UI
without needing to restore to iCloud Drive first.

## Current Limitations

The iCloud Drive integration is in beta and has some known limitations:

- **iCloud Photos**: The iCloud Drive API does not provide access to photos
  stored in iCloud Photos. You cannot back up your iCloud Photos library with
  this integration.
- **App-Specific Data**: Some app containers and system-managed data may not be
  accessible through the standard iCloud Drive API.
