## Why protecting Dropbox matters

Dropbox is excellent for syncing and sharing files instantly, but syncing is not
the same as a backup. Because Dropbox mirrors your actions across all devices,
any mistake or error can spread everywhere at once:

- **Instant Deletion**: If you or a collaborator accidentally delete a folder,
  that deletion spreads to every linked computer immediately.
- **Limited Recovery**: Dropbox has a specific "trash" window, but if data loss
  is discovered after that window closes, those files may be permanently gone.
- **Ransomware**: If your local files are hit by malware, Dropbox will sync the
  versions encrypted by malware, overwriting your healthy data in the cloud.

For your important projects and shared team folders, you need an independent
record of your data that remains safe, verifiable, and restorable no matter what
happens in your live Dropbox environment.

## Dropbox Shared Responsibility Model

Dropbox operates under a
[shared responsibility model](https://assets.dropbox.com/documents/en/trust/shared-responsibility-guide.pdf)
where Dropbox secures the infrastructure, you're responsible for protecting your
data. Plakar ensures you meet your side with independent, verifiable backups.

To learn more about the general idea about the shared responsibility model you
can check the docs on
[why you should backup your SaaS](../../../docs/community/main/explanations/why-should-i-backup-my-saas).

## Security and Compromise

Dropbox relies on account credentials that can be targeted or lost through
simple mistakes. If an account is compromised or a connected app behaves
unexpectedly:

- **Mass Data Loss**: Unauthorized access can result in the deletion or
  corruption of years of data in seconds.
- **Synchronization Issues**: Malicious or accidental changes can be replicated
  instantly across your entire team.
- **No Manual Recovery**: Once data is deleted and the trash window has expired,
  there is often no way to recover the lost information.

Plakar creates immutable snapshots of your data that are end-to-end encrypted
with keys that you own. This ensures your data remains private and secure even
if your Dropbox account security is ever compromised.

Plakar also allows for direct inspection of your backups. You can easily browse,
search, or verify the integrity of your history via the CLI or UI without
needing to perform a full restore first.

## How Plakar secures your Dropbox workflows

Plakar integrates with Dropbox as a flexible bridge for your data in these ways:

- **Source Connector**: Take snapshots of your Dropbox data and backup to a
  secure Kloset Store.
- **Storage Connector**: Use Dropbox as the "vault" to store your encrypted and
  deduplicated Plakar backups from other sources.
- **Destination Connector**: Restore verified snapshots directly back into your
  Dropbox account exactly when you need them.

Plakar uses deduplication to minimize storage space and bandwidth usage while
preserving full snapshot history.
