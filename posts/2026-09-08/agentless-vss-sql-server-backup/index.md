For twenty years, backing up Windows meant paying the same tax: an agent on
every machine or a vendor holding the keys to your own data. VSS, the Windows
service that quietly makes a consistent copy of a running system, and SQL Server
are front and center, reachable mostly through an enterprise backup suite or a
tool you have to install on every host.

Everything else moved on. We went from monoliths to microservices, from physical
hardware to containers and Kubernetes, from one on-prem data center to multi
clouds. Infrastructure is now run as code: you declare it in Git, it scales
dynamically and includes self-healing mechanisms and multi-region disaster
recovery (DR) strategies, managed programmatically. That pace is only
accelerating as companies integrate AI into their development process. We've
built a world of automated, cloud-native infrastructure resilience, but the data
protection layer remains obsolete.

Every other layer of your stack has an open format you can read and an API you
can call. Backup should too. It should be declared as code, agentless, fully
encrypted, deduplicated and portable. That is proper resilience, and today it
comes to Windows!

## VSS and SQL Server: free in Plakar

Plakar's [VSS](/integrations/vss/) and [SQL Server](/integrations/mssql/)
integrations now run at no cost with Plakar: agentless, self-hosted, no per-VM
license, no vendor standing between you and your own recovery. Everything lands
in an encrypted, deduplicated
[Kloset store](/posts/2025-04-29/kloset-the-immutable-data-store/) that lives
nowhere near the machine it protects.

These two connectors are built for Plakar Control Plane and are free to use for
any registered Plakar user. Their code stays closed for now, but that changes
nothing about how your data is stored or who controls it: everything they
capture lands in the same open, portable, client-side encrypted Kloset store as
the rest of Plakar, and the Plakar CLI and the Kloset format remain fully open
source. There is no proprietary archive and no vendor-locked vault. Any snapshot
these connectors create stays readable with the open-source Plakar CLI, the keys
never leave your side, and you can always get your data back without a
closed-source tool.

## How agentless VSS backup works

In a nutshell, Plakar connects to the Windows host over SSH and asks VSS for a
snapshot. VSS puts the volume in a consistent state first, streams the result
over SFTP, splits it into small chunks, removes the duplicates, compresses them,
and encrypts them. The storage only ever sees encrypted data, and the keys stay
on your side.

Data is
[encrypted client-side](/posts/2025-02-28/audit-of-plakar-cryptography/), the
Kloset store sits outside the domain, and the account Plakar connects with is
not your domain admin. If the domain is compromised, the copy remains completely
safe.

## Unlocking MSSQL Backup

Database backups are the request we hear most, and SQL Server is near the top of
the list. Databases are the most painful thing to lose and the hardest thing to
restore correctly, which is why so many teams still run them through
hand-written scripts and scheduled tasks nobody wants to own.

After [Postgres](/integrations/postgres/) and [MySQL](/integrations/mysql/), you
can now back up your SQL Server database with Plakar. Plakar asks VSS for an
application-consistent, point-in-time snapshot of the volume the database sits
on, so the copy is clean and complete without taking the database offline. No
dump scripts, no agent, no downtime, and you restore it onto the original server
or a fresh one.

## Active Directory available in Plakar Control Plane

If you are running Windows workloads in a regulated environment, you are
probably wondering about Active Directory. In a Windows environment, almost
everything runs through Active Directory. Who can log in, what they can touch,
and which systems they can reach all depend on it being up and correct.

In case you missed it, [Active Directory](/integrations/msad/) is already
covered through the Plakar Control Plane. While a Domain Controller is still
healthy, Plakar takes an encrypted System State backup (everything Windows needs
to bring that controller back) and stores it outside the domain. So even if
every Domain Controller is lost at once, you can rebuild your whole Active
Directory from a clean, off-domain copy.

Active Directory is the one you restore first when ransomware takes the domain,
because nothing else works until it is back. The restore is the normal Windows
path (System State via Directory Services Restore Mode); full steps are in the
[Active Directory docs](/docs/control-plane/resources/identity/msad/).

## Get started

Download Plakar to try the VSS and SQL Server backups. Several installation
methods are available depending on your operating system.
[Choose the method that best suits your environment](/docs/community/v1.1.0/quickstart/installation/).

If you want to
[try Windows Active Directory](/docs/control-plane/intro/installation/), Plakar
Control Plane has a free plan including up to 500GB of managed data, making it
well suited for small configurations, personal use, or evaluating the platform
before committing to a larger deployment.
