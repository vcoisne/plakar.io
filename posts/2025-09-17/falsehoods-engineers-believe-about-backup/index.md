Here is a list of common false assumptions about backup that I’ve heard
repeatedly over the past year from discussions with engineers, CTOs, and
sysadmins across various industries. These misconceptions often sound
reasonable, but they create a false sense of safety until reality strikes.

- **If a backup finished successfully, it can be restored**  
  A backup that completes without errors doesn't guarantee it can be restored.

  Most failures happen during recovery due to corruption, misconfiguration, or
  missing pieces.

  _[(Gitlab incident)](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/)_
  In 2017, a maintenance mistake wiped the primary database and multiple backups
  failed validation, forcing a restore that lost about six hours of production
  data.

- **RAID, replication, or snapshots are backups**  
  They are not. These mechanisms protect availability, not recoverability. They
  replicate corruption, deletions, and ransomware with impressive speed.

  Replication synchronizes data including accidental deletions or corruptions.
  Backups preserve history and offer rollback.

  _[(Meta)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11245)_ Meta documented “silent data
  corruptions” from faulty CPUs that replication dutifully propagated across
  systems, proving redundancy isn’t the same as recoverability.

- **Cloud providers back up my data**  
  They don’t. All cloud providers offer at the best durability and redundancy,
  not backups. You are responsible for protecting your own data.

  They all use a shared responsibility model that clearly states that backups
  are your job and implicitly (or clearly) state that you should backup you data
  out of their scope.

  _[(Google cloud UniSuper incident)](https://blocksandfiles.com/2024/05/14/google-cloud-unisuper/)_
  In 2024, a Google Cloud provisioning misconfiguration deleted UniSuper’s
  entire GCVE environment across regions—service was down for two weeks until
  backups were rebuilt.

- **The database files are enough to recover the database** Not without
  transaction logs or consistency coordination. Copying raw files doesn't
  guarantee usable data.  
  _[(Microsoft TechCommunity: top 5 reasons why backup goes wrong)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuregovernanceandmanagementblog/the-top-5-reasons-why-backup-and-recovery-in-the-cloud-goes-wrong-and-how-to-avo/3676072?utm_source=chatgpt.com)_

  Microsoft’s guidance highlights real-world restores that fail because required
  logs/consistency points weren’t captured—even when raw database files existed.

- **Our backups are safe from ransomware**  
  If they are accessible from the network, they are a primary target. Ransomware
  hits backups first. Isolation and immutability are critical.

  To prevent data leakage, backups should be encrypted, but you can still lose
  access to your data if the ransomware also encrypts or deletes your backups.

  _[(PerCSoft / DDS Safe)](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/ransomware-bites-dental-data-backup-firm/)_
  A ransomware attack on the dental-backup provider encrypted the cloud backups
  of hundreds of practices, leaving many without a usable recovery point.

- **A well-configured S3 bucket doesn't require backup**  
  Even a perfectly configured S3 bucket - with Versioning, Object Lock
  (Compliance mode), and MFA Delete - is not a backup.

  AWS itself advises creating immutable copies in an isolated secondary account
  to protect against breaches, misconfigurations, compromised credentials, or
  accidental deletions. The official architecture (AWS Storage Blog, 2023)
  explicitly shows that replication and object-lock alone do not protect you
  from logical corruption or account compromise: you must replicate to a
  separate, restricted account to keep an independent, immutable copy.

  In practice, replication can also amplify failures or ransomware attacks if
  not isolated: when the source data is encrypted or deleted, the replication
  faithfully propagates the damage to the destination. This is why AWS
  recommends automated suspension of replication when suspicious PUT or DELETE
  activity is detected a classic anti-ransomware safeguard.

  S3 is designed for durability, not recoverability. A “well-configured bucket”
  ensures data isn’t lost due to hardware failure, but it won’t help you recover
  from a logic error, a bad IAM policy, or an API key compromise. True
  protection requires an independent, immutable backup ideally in another
  account or region, with Object Lock compliance and strict key isolation.

- **Encryption in transit and at rest is not end-to-end security for backup**  
  Real E2E means client-side encryption with customer-held keys. If the backup
  server or its KMS can decrypt, an attacker who compromises it can too.

  CVE-2023-27532 shows the risk: an unauthenticated actor could query Veeam
  Backup Service and pull encrypted credentials from the config database, then
  pivot to hosts and repositories. It was exploited in the wild.

- **Incremental backups are always safer and faster**  
  Not always. Long incremental chains rely on an index/catalog; if it’s
  corrupted or unavailable, the chain becomes unusable—one bad link can break
  the whole sequence.

  Example Commvault: when an Index V2 becomes corrupted, it’s marked Critical
  and, on the next browse/restore, Commvault rebuilds only from the latest
  cycle, making intermediate incremental points unavailable (common error: “The
  index cannot be accessed”). This can happen silently if the index is corrupted
  but still readable, leading to unnoticed data loss until a restore is needed.

- **A daily backup is enough**  
  For most modern systems, losing 23 hours of data is not acceptable. Recovery
  Point Objectives must match business needs.

  _Why_: in many businesses, one day of irreversible data loss ≈ one full day of
  revenue (orders, invoices, subscriptions, transactions that can’t be
  reconstructed), plus re-work and SLA penalties. For mid-to-large companies,
  that can quickly reach millions of euros.

  _Rule-of-thumb_:  
  Cost of a 24h RPO ≈ (Daily net revenue) + (Re-entry/reconciliation labor) +
  (SLA/chargebacks) + (churn/opportunity loss).

  _[(Gitlab incident)](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/)_
  GitLab’s postmortem shows how relying on a single daily point risks losing an
  entire day’s business activity in one incident.

- **Backup storage will always be available**  
  Storage fills up, disks fail, and credentials expire. Many backup systems stop
  quietly when that happens.

  _Why_: Capacity: backup jobs commonly fail with “There is not enough space on
  the disk,” and operations like synthetic fulls/merges require extra temporary
  space (so “TBs free” can still be insufficient).
  - Index/metadata growth: index restores can balloon and fill disks, blocking
    browse/restore and further jobs (Commvault Index Restore filling the index
    disk; guidance on index cache pressure).
  - Expired credentials/tokens: cloud backups fail when AWS tokens or Azure SAS
    credentials expire (e.g., S3 ExpiredToken, SAS token expiry breaks
    backup-to-URL).

- **Backup is an IT problem**  
  It's not. It's a business continuity and risk management concern. Recovery
  priorities should be defined at the business level.

Most backup incidents go underreported: for obvious reasons, vendors and
affected organizations rarely disclose full details. All the more reason to
master the fundamentals (RPO/RTO, isolation, immutability, key separation) and
to regularly test restores don’t wait for public post-mortems to learn.

We are building Plakar as an Open Source project to help everyone protect their
data effectively and cover all these bases.
