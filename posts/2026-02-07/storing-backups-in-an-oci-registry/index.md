Three weeks ago, Julien and I were invited by
[Bret Fisher](https://www.youtube.com/@BretFisher) on his podcast,
[Cloud Native DevOps and Docker Talk](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX0bTycx8m-UhIXY2c4-7AXaEokaTdn6S).

The discussion was very interesting and, after the show, Bret casually mentioned
that we should really add an OCI registry storage integration.

Up to that point, my knowledge of OCI registries came mostly from conversations
with SREs, I had never worked with them directly. But since I had claimed during
the show that writing a storage integration was _easy_, it felt like the perfect
opportunity to put code where my mouth is.

The next day, after wrapping my work, I jumped on the task. Half an hour later,
I announced on our Discord that the OCI registry integration was already
working.

This is not a flex, and it’s not because I’m particularly fast or good.

It happened that quickly because extending Plakar is genuinely simple. We
designed the storage layer so that adding a new backend is trivial. I honestly
believe we’ve lowered the bar enough that a first-year computer science student
could implement a new Plakar storage backend as a weekend project.

That’s exactly the kind of extensibility we were aiming for: not just
_possible_, but _boringly easy_.

## First of all, what is an OCI Registry?

An **OCI registry** is a standardized service for storing, versioning, and
distributing binary artifacts. While best known for container images, it is not
limited to them.

OCI stands for **Open Container Initiative**, an open governance body that
defines vendor-neutral standards for containers. One of these standards, the
**OCI Distribution Specification**, defines how clients and registries
communicate over HTTP to push, pull, and manage artifacts.

In short, an **OCI registry** is a content-addressable, HTTP-based artifact
store with strong guarantees around immutability and integrity.

### From container images to general artifacts

OCI registries were originally designed for **container images** (for example,
Docker Hub), but the underlying model is generic.

An OCI artifact consists of:

- one or more **blobs** (binary data)
- a **manifest** describing those blobs
- optionally an **index** to group variants
- identifiers based on **cryptographic digests**, not filenames

Because of this, OCI registries are now used to distribute much more than
containers, including Helm charts, WASM modules, VM images, CLI tools, plugins,
policies, signatures, and other software artifacts.

### Content-addressed and immutable by design

All content in an OCI registry is addressed by its hash (typically SHA-256).
This provides:

- **Integrity**: pulled content is exactly what was pushed
- **Deduplication**: identical blobs are stored once
- **Immutability**: any change results in a new digest
- **Efficient caching**: blobs can be safely cached and reused

Tags such as `latest` or `v1.2.3` are merely mutable references. The true
identity of an artifact is its digest.

### Why OCI registries in our context ?

OCI registries have become a **universal distribution layer** because they are
standardized, widely deployed, secure, and efficient at scale. They are also
deeply integrated into modern CI/CD ecosystems.

If you need a reliable way to publish, version, and retrieve large or immutable
artifacts, an OCI registry is often the simplest and most robust solution, and
you don’t need to be shipping containers to benefit from it.

## How does it tie to Plakar ?

In many aspects, the kloset storage layer is very similar to an OCI registry and
the primitives map fairly well one to another.

During backups, Plakar will generate packfiles that are MAC-indexed in kloset
and will locate the data through that MAC. The storage layer can store these
packfiles in the OCI registry and map the MAC to the blob through a manifest.
With this plumbing in place, calls are mapped 1:1 with the registry with
manifests being used to locate the blob by MAC.

### Installing the OCI registry integration

At the time of this writing, the OCI registry integration has been
[committed to a public repository](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/integration-oci)
and is **only available for plakar v1.1.0-beta**.

To test it, you first need to install our latest beta of plakar:

```sh
$ go install github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar@v1.1.0-beta.4
```

You can their either use our prebuilt package by authenticating to our platform:

```sh
$ plakar login
[...]
$ plakar pkg add oci
```

Or build the integration yourself...

```sh
$ plakar pkg build oci
/usr/bin/make -C /var/folders/9x/9k0f6mc10sbd0_kfx63__fvc0000gn/T/build-oci-v1.1.0-beta.4-510526837
48317f2d: OK ✓ /
48317f2d: OK ✓ /manifest.yaml
48317f2d: OK ✓ /ociStorage
Plugin created successfully: oci_v1.1.0-beta.4_darwin_arm64.ptar
```

... and install the resulting ptar:

```sh
$ plakar pkg add ./oci_v1.1.0-beta.4_darwin_arm64.ptar
```

That's it, you're good to go !

### Launching a registry container

The easiest way to test is to simply start a docker container for the OCI
registry.

This can be done with this simple command, which will run the container and bind
the registry to port 5000 on localhost:

```sh
$ docker run -d --name oci-registry \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v $(pwd)/registry-data:/var/lib/registry \
  registry:2
b61a4bc5df40307b6301d30f692cd276db64acd8448258ba49f2a4c6c760cb8c
```

### Using Plakar with the registry container

To avoid having to type the passphrase over and over in this article, I just
start by setting the `PLAKAR_PASSPHRASE` environment variable to a key that I
generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`:

```sh
$ export PLAKAR_PASSPHRASE=6292d531ecede679b5e4afbbe9ce994a78c9c7986c742e97232f2730b8bfb5df
```

Once this is done, I can create the store:

```sh
$ plakar at oci://localhost:5000/helloworld create
```

Then backup my current directory:

```sh
$ plakar -silent at oci://localhost:5000/helloworld backup
```

The snapshot is now in store and can be inspected as usual:

```sh
$ plakar at oci://localhost:5000/helloworld ls
2026-01-16T22:22:25Z   d61ae1c6   216 MiB        1s /Users/gilles/Wip/github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar
```

Including its content:

```sh
$ ./plakar at oci://localhost:5134/helloworld cat d61:LICENSE

Everything is browsable as with any other storage through our UI:

```

## Limitations

This is the first iteration of the integration. It is not production-ready and
currently lacks some important features, such as authentication.

The goal was to build a functional proof of concept first, it will now need
polishing and hardening before real-world use.

## Conclusion

This integration was not originally planned; it emerged from a casual
discussion.

Even without prior knowledge of OCI registries, it took roughly half an hour to
implement, which is a good demonstration of how easy it is to extend Plakar to
new use cases.

Let us know what you think, and don’t hesitate to suggest new ideas!
