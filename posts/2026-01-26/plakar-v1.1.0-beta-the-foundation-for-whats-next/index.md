In case you missed it, here is a video recap of our 2025 retrospective. It
highlights just how impressive the amount of work delivered by our team has
been, with meaningful progress and achievements every single month
throughout 2025.

I cannot overstate how proud I am to be part of a team that maintains such a
strong focus on quality, while still moving at a very high pace and delivering
consistently, week after week.

{{< youtubeLite id="Kdo3ibZNOGA" >}}

At this pace, whenever we go more than a week without communicating, it feels
like we have been silent for ages. In reality, it has only been a couple of
months since our last community release and just one month since our enterprise
preview release.

That said, we have not shared many updates about the community edition since
November, as our focus has been on building the enterprise edition. The two are
far from isolated: they share the same building blocks, and a significant part
of the work done for the enterprise edition now flows back into the community
edition.

## TL;DR

- v1.1.0-beta is out, stable and fully backward compatible. We expect RC in
  February and the final release in March.
- What’s new: a cleaner terminal UI, multi-directory backups (single source),
  much better FUSE mounting (plus HTTP mounts), and a new package manager for
  integrations.
- Reliability: the old agent is gone and replaced by a tiny background service
  called cached that only manages shared cache and locking while commands run in
  the CLI.
- Performance: big wins in our Korpus tests, especially restore speeds. More
  backup latency improvements are coming with the next optimizations.
- Memory and disk: peak RAM use is down, and the VFS cache footprint is much
  smaller by trading a bit of bandwidth for disk space.
- For integrators: importer/exporter/store interfaces are much simpler, so
  writing a connector is easier than before.
- Next up: point-in-time recovery, multi-source snapshots, better store
  maintenance and repair tools, and packfile work.
- Try it, tell us what breaks, and help shape the final release.

## Announcing plakar v1.1.0-beta

Throughout 2025, we released **four updates to the v1.0.x branch** of plakar’s
community edition, each bringing its share of improvements and new features. As
we begin 2026, roughly two months after our last release, we are entering the
beta phase of the v1.1.0 branch, which packs **a lot** of new capabilities and
internal improvements.

Beta often implies instability, but in this case most of the work for the v1.1.0
branch was completed during the second half of 2025. Since then, we have already
run thousands, if not tens of thousands, of snapshots through this codebase.

So while this is still a beta and should not be used on production stores, it is
already very stable. We strongly encourage you to try it out, especially since
it is fully backward compatible. You can safely create a new store, sync your
data to it, and experiment with the beta without impacting existing setups.

The goal of this beta phase is to gather user feedback, polish areas we may have
missed in both code and documentation, and gain additional confidence before a
final release, given the significant amount of work that has gone into this
branch.

Our current plan is to move from beta to release candidate during February, and
from release candidate to a final release in March. New development during this
period will continue on our main development branch and will only be backported
to beta or release candidates when it is clearly low risk.

## How can you help?

Feel free to join our Discord channel and help us by testing the beta and
reporting any issues you encounter. Your feedback is invaluable and directly
helps shape the final release.

```sh
$ go install github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar@v1.1.0-beta.3

## What's new?

The v1.1.0 branch introduces a lot of new features as well as improvements all
over the place.

### Terminal UI

Starting with the most visible change.

Until now, plakar’s terminal output was very verbose. While this provided a lot
of information, it made it difficult to track progress and quickly identify what
mattered during long-running operations.

<video controls width="800">
  <source src="tui-stdio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

In v1.1.0, terminal output has been completely reworked around a new terminal UI
rendering interface. We introduced an `stdio` renderer, which preserves the
exact same output format as before, and a new `tui` renderer that provides a
dedicated terminal UI for better visibility during long-running jobs.

<video controls width="800">
  <source src="tui-tea.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

This makes it easier to understand what plakar is doing at a glance, while still
retaining access to detailed output when needed. The result is a quieter, more
readable terminal experience, especially for long-running backups and restores.

The new `tui` view is available on `backup` and `restore` commands but we will
progressively cover more commands, such as `check` or `sync` as we go.

### Multi-directory support

The v1.1.0 branch introduces **support for multi-directory backups**.

```sh
$ plakar backup /etc /home
```

Early versions of plakar only supported filesystem-based backups, which made
multi-directory snapshots straightforward. When additional integrations were
introduced, however, resource naming collisions became possible: a local path
such as `/etc` could clash with an object path like `s3://bucket/etc`.

To avoid ambiguity, multi-directory support was temporarily removed until it
could be implemented in a clear and unambiguous way across all integrations.

With v1.1.0, this limitation is now lifted and multi-directory backups are once
again supported **on a single source**. Work to unlock multi-source backups has
begun but could not be completed in time for this release, hopefully it can land
in the next one.

### Better FUSE and mounting

FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) allows plakar snapshots to be mounted as a
regular filesystem, making it possible to browse snapshot contents as if they
were present on disk. This makes it possible to use your operating system’s
standard tools on data contained in plakar snapshots seamlessly, without having
to actually restore the data to disk: structure and data is transparently
streamed as it is accessed.

<video controls width="100%">
  <source src="fuse.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Our FUSE support was fairly stable on Linux, despite occasional hiccups. On
macOS, the situation was more complicated, as FUSE is not supported natively.
Using FUSE required installing a kernel extension, which was cumbersome to set
up, but for which we provided stable support... or relying on the FUSE-T
implementation, which was friendlier to the users as it uses NFS v4 local server
instead of kernel extension, but with which plakar didn't play well with.

In v1.1.0, FUSE support has been completely rewritten and significantly
improved, making it more reliable, including over high-latency connections.

At the same time, the `plakar mount` command was extended to support mounting
specific snapshots or individual snapshot directories. We also introduced
support for exposing mounts over HTTP, making it possible to serve a specific
directory from a specific snapshot over HTTP.

![](httpmount.png)

Work is ongoing to support additional mount protocols, including S3.

### New package manager

We have provided a means for users to install integrations through a plugin
system in v1.0.0, but our package manager was a bit... meh.

Our beta comes with a brand new package manager that's simpler, cleaner and much
more featureful. I won't spoil too much as I think we'll have a dedicated
article on it, but at the very least I can spoil that it supports integrations
updates which is something we were lacking.

### New integration interfaces

The importer, exporter, and storage interfaces have been redesigned to be
simpler and more explicit. This work lays the groundwork for faster iteration
and more reliable third-party integrations.

A new store backend can now be implemented by satisfying a simple interface. In
practice, this means that almost anything capable of `List`, `Put`, `Get`, and
`Delete` operations can be used to host a Kloset store:

```go
type Store interface {
	Create(context.Context, []byte) error
	Open(context.Context) ([]byte, error)
	Ping(context.Context) error

	Origin() string
	Type() string
	Root() string
	Flags() location.Flags
	Mode(context.Context) (Mode, error)
	Size(context.Context) (int64, error)

	List(context.Context, StorageResource) ([]objects.MAC, error)
	Put(context.Context, StorageResource, objects.MAC, io.Reader) (int64, error)
	Get(context.Context, StorageResource, objects.MAC, *Range) (io.ReadCloser, error)
	Delete(context.Context, StorageResource, objects.MAC) error

	Close(ctx context.Context) error
}
```

On the importer side, the interface now turns any data source that can be
enumerated into a candidate for being backed up by plakar:

```go
type Importer interface {
	Origin() string
	Type() string
	Root() string
	Flags() location.Flags
	Ping(context.Context) error
	Import(context.Context, chan<- *connectors.Record, <-chan *connectors.Result) error
	Close(context.Context) error
}
```

Finally, on the exporter side, a symmetrical interface makes it possible to
restore data by receiving an enumeration of resources and their contents:

```go
type Exporter interface {
	Origin() string
	Type() string
	Root() string
	Flags() location.Flags
	Ping(context.Context) error
	Export(context.Context, <-chan *connectors.Record, chan<- *connectors.Result) error
	Close(context.Context) error
}
```

A side effect of this rework is that an Importer can become the input to an
Exporter, something that was not possible with previous interfaces. This will
simplify the testing considerably and allow the implementation of a new
"transfer" capability to synchronize origins and destinations without going
through a Kloset!

That set aside, with these interfaces, developers can easily extend plakar
without needing to understand its internal architecture:

Implement a few simple CRUD functions and you have a new store. Implement a
function that enumerates your dataset and you have a new importer. Implement a
function that reconstructs a dataset from an enumeration and you have a new
exporter.

We believe this significantly lowers the barrier to entry. Writing a first
integration can now take just a few hours for newcomers, and only minutes for
experienced developers. I think we will start seeing some Twitch sessions of
integration development from our team soon :-)

### Improved performance

Contrary to common assumption, backup and restore complexity isn’t driven by
total bytes but by per-item work: tree traversal and stat calls, open/close
overhead, lots of small random I/O, hashing/chunking each object, dedup lookups
and metadata handling, plus the CPU, memory and coordination costs that come
with huge file counts and deep directory trees. So beyond a few dozen GiB, total
size ceases to be informative: transfer time scales roughly linearly and is
determined by raw storage or network throughput, not by the metadata, CPU, and
I/O-seek costs that actually make backups hard.

We measure performance with **Korpus**, an assorted collection of resources
(low- and high-entropy; small and large; images, audio, video, text, code, PDFs,
etc.) laid out across a very large, deep directory tree.

| Op      | Items     | v1.0.6      | v1.1.0-beta           |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Backup  | 1.000.000 | ~3 minutes  | ~3 minutes            |
| Sync    | 1.000.000 | ~5 minutes  | ~5 minutes            |
| Restore | 1.000.000 | ~60 minutes | ~3 minutes **(-95%)** |
| Check   | 1.000.000 | ~1 minute   | ~1 minute             |

<small>\*tested on a 14-core mac mini with 64 GiB RAM and NVMe storage.</small>

Note the **dramatic** improvement for Restore which is due to several changes:

- a better algorithm for restore
- a better use of parallelism
- a better use of our prefetch mechanism
- the removal of some expensive system calls that were not strictly necessary

We didn't include most of our backup optimizations in v1.1.0-beta: they're
fairly recent and we didn't want them to interfere with the release cycle as
we're already happy with unoptimized performances. Most of them will be merged
during the beta phase, others may have to wait for the next release in Q2.

| Op      | Items     | v1.0.6      | v1.1.0-beta (w/optimizations) |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Backup  | 1.000.000 | ~3 minutes  | ~2 minutes **(-33%)**         |
| Sync    | 1.000.000 | ~5 minutes  | ~4 minutes **(-20%)**         |
| Restore | 1.000.000 | ~60 minutes | ~3 minutes **(-95%)**         |
| Check   | 1.000.000 | ~1 minute   | ~1 minute                     |

<small>\*tested on a 14-core mac mini with 64 GiB RAM and NVMe storage.</small>

Note that we also have plans for further optimizations, which we have not yet
pushed past the point of initial experimentation, and which show promising
results in all cases for future releases.

### Improved RAM usage

We received reports of high memory usage during certain operations.
Investigations revealed two separate root causes and we’ve made targeted fixes
that already show measurable improvements.

The first issue was a gRPC-level memory leak that mostly affected long-running
backups using integrations (notably SFTP and S3). We reviewed the gRPC code path
end-to-end and applied a series of fixes to eliminate the leak and stabilise
long jobs.

The second issue stemmed from the third-party cache implementation we were
using. Replacing this component was non-trivial as our cache layer must satisfy
strict correctness and performance properties and there are few viable
alternatives. Over a focused three-month effort we reworked the caching
subsystem: while we haven’t yet removed the old implementation completely, the
changes already deliver clear RAM reductions and better behaviour under load.

Lastly, we now default to spilling temporary data to disk rather than keeping it
all in memory. The performance impact is small, but the memory savings are
significant, it is a practical trade that greatly improves stability for large
or long-running operations.

|         | v1.0.6                                            | v1.1.0-beta                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Backup  | ~3.0 GiB <br />![graph](procmon-v100-backup.png)  | ~1.3 GiB **(-43%)** <br />![graph](procmon-v110-backup.png)  |
| Sync    | ~3.6 GiB <br />![graph](procmon-v100-sync.png)    | ~1.7 GiB **(-52%)** <br />![graph](procmon-v110-sync.png)    |

<small>\*tested on a 14-core mac mini with 64 GiB RAM and NVMe storage.</small>

There's still some room for improvement but memory usage being a factor of
concurrency, this is controllable by reducing concurrency to an amount that
suits the RAM requirements.

### Improved cache space

The local cache was taking too much space, so we reworked caching to reduce
on-disk usage.

Plakar uses three caches:

- **State cache**: not really a cache but a required copy of the store state
  used to decide whether data needs to be pushed. It’s synchronized before an
  operation and recreated if missing, so it must remain local.
- **VFS cache**: stores metadata for resources as last seen so we can skip work
  (and avoid recomputing chunks) when a resource appears unchanged. We removed
  the on-disk VFS cache and now query the store instead, saving local storage in
  exchange for additional bandwidth. During the beta we’ll add a flag to prefer
  the previous local-cache behaviour when that makes more sense.
- **Scan cache**: a transient cache built during operations and discarded when
  the operation completes.

Removing the on-disk VFS cache has **significantly reduced** local cache usage
for large trees by trading some bandwidth for disk space, while still allowing
users to opt back into a local cache to save bandwidth when desired.

|     Items | v1.0.6 |        v1.1.0-beta |
| --------: | -----: | -----------------: |
| 1,000,000 |  4 GiB | 1.8 GiB **(-55%)** |

In short: less local disk usage by default, an explicit option to favour the old
local cache if you prefer lower bandwidth, and the required state cache still
ensures correctness and fast change detection.

### Agent is dead. Long live cached.

When you use backup software, you expect to be able to run multiple commands in
parallel. This implies some level of shared cache and state.

In **plakar v1.0.0**, to coordinate access and handle locking, we introduced an
_agent_ process that executed commands on behalf of the CLI. This meant the
agent had to be running for anything to work at all, which quickly proved to be
a fairly annoying requirement.

To address this, **plakar v1.0.4** introduced an auto-spawned, auto-teardown
agent. While this improved usability, the agent remained on the critical path.
Every command was still executed by the agent, with the CLI merely proxying
input and output.

This design came with drawbacks:

- Interactive prompting was difficult or impossible for some integrations, for
  example SFTP passphrase prompts.
- A failure in a single command, including an out-of-memory condition, could
  take down the agent rather than just the operation.
- The agent accumulated complexity by combining execution, coordination, and
  cache management in a single process.

With **plakar v1.1.0**, the agent is gone.

It is replaced by **cached**, a lightweight, auto-managed process dedicated
exclusively to shared cache maintenance and locking. **cached** will
automagically start if needed and stop when not needed anymore, so you never
have to think about it. Commands now execute directly in the CLI, while cached
ensures safe, coordinated access to the cache.

This separation of responsibilities simplifies the architecture, dramatically
reduces the failure blast radius, unlocks features that were previously
difficult to implement, and makes plakar **considerably more reliable**.

## And... plenty more

It is difficult to write about everything we have been working on while
remaining concise, especially since much of this work is not immediately
visible.

Since v1.0.6, there have been hundreds of commits to Kloset, hundreds more to
plakar itself, and dozens across various integrations. Altogether, this
represents thousands of lines of changes, peer-reviewed and approved, spread
over several months and across multiple subsystems of our software.

Several of these changes will be covered in dedicated articles, as we plan to
significantly increase our technical writing to this blog this year.

## What’s next?

The immediate next step is the stabilization of the beta, followed by the
release of **v1.1.0-rc** and then **v1.1.0**.

In parallel, we are continuing work on several major features. Much of the
prerequisite groundwork for these efforts has already been completed as part of
the v1.1.0 development cycle, and some of them already have active
implementation branches.

The next major milestones include:

- **Point-in-time recovery (PITR)** support, enabling more robust and precise
  database backups.
- **Multi-source snapshots**, allowing a single snapshot to span multiple data
  sources.
- **Improved store maintenance and space recovery**, through recompaction and
  packfile optimizations.
- **Store repairability**, with mechanisms to recover from corruption, including
  ECC and cross-store data sharing.

Stay tuned, and happy hacking 🚀
