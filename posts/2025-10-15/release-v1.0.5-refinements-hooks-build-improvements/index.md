Hot on the heels of v1.0.4, we’re excited to ship **Plakar v1.0.5** — a release
packed with **build refinements**, **pipeline tuning**, **hook support for
backups**, and **smaller but meaningful quality-of-life updates** across the
board.

This version sets the stage for smoother integrations, better developer
ergonomics, and more flexible automation.

## Build & Packaging Improvements

We’ve improved the **build process** to make distribution cleaner and more
robust:

- ✅ **Fixed Homebrew packaging** to ensure a smooth experience on macOS
  ([#1684](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1684))
- 🪟 **Added Windows builds** for broader platform support
  ([#1685](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1685))
- 📦 Multiple dependency bumps, including:
  - `golang.org/x/tools`, `golang.org/x/mod`
  - `google.golang.org/grpc`
  - `github.com/spf13/viper`
  - `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea`
  - `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10`

These changes ensure a more consistent, up-to-date development environment
across all platforms.

## UI & Documentation Updates

- New **social links** and **documentation references** have been added
  ([#1706](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1706)).
- **Plakar UI** has been synced to the latest `main@4a02561` revision
  ([#1710](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1710)), with simplified
  asset serving ([#1718](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1718)).
- CI was fixed to properly update the UI as part of the build
  ([#1709](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1709)).
- Manual pages were enhanced to better describe the `import` command
  ([#1730](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1730)).

Together, these improvements polish the interface and documentation, making
Plakar more accessible and discoverable.

---

## Pipeline & Concurrency Tuning

Since turning backup into a **pipeline**, we’ve adjusted concurrency levels to
better align with the new architecture
([#1713](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1713)).

This change improves stability and resource usage during heavy operations,
paving the way for further optimizations in future versions.

---

## Backup Hooks & Sync Enhancements

A key new feature in v1.0.5 is **hook support for backup commands**:

- Added **pre-hook** and **post-hook** CLI flags to `plakar backup`
  ([#1727](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1727))
- Hooks now work seamlessly on **Windows** too
  ([#1741](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1741))
- Added **fail hooks**, allowing users to trigger custom actions when backups
  fail ([#1743](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1743))
- Introduced support for `passphrase_cmd` during sync operations
  ([#1744](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1744))

These additions unlock more powerful automation and integration scenarios,
letting you plug Plakar more deeply into existing workflows.

## Maintenance & Internal Refinements

Other notable changes include:

- **Improved type safety** in `DecodeRPC`
  ([#1721](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1721))
- Clearer messaging around **grace periods**
  ([#1717](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1717))
- Better **login requirement clarifications**
  ([#1715](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1715))
- Enhanced handling for **missing locations**
  ([#1716](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1716))
- Removed unused code paths and simplified plugin arguments
  ([#1724](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1724),
  [#1726](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1726),
  [#1729](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1729))
- Added a `cache-mem-size` parameter for finer cache control
  ([#1738](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1738))
- Miscellaneous bug fixes, including proper error handling for missing stores
  ([#1725](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1725)) and filter overrides
  ([#1737](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1737))

These refinements make the codebase leaner, more predictable, and easier to
maintain.
