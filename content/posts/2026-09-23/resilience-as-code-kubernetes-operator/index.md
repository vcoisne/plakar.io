Platform teams run their clusters, networking, secrets and policies as code. All
of it is declared in Git, reviewed in pull requests, and often reconciled into
Kubernetes by a controller. This practice is called infrastructure as code, and
is increasingly popular in the cloud-native ecosystem.

Backup is the exception. For most engineering teams it is still done manually in
a complex UI console, unversioned and managed in silos. And because it is
manual, it drifts. Your data surface keeps growing on its own: a team ships a
service with a new PersistentVolumeClaim, someone stands up a database in a
namespace the backup admin has never heard of. The configuration in the console
does not know any of it exists, so it silently falls behind. That makes your
backups impossible to reconstruct from source, hard to audit and slow to
operate.

GitOps already solved this for the rest of your infrastructure. There is no good
reason to leave data protection out. What made infrastructure as code popular
was never the YAML, it was the loop behind it: a controller that continuously
reconciles reality against the declared state, notices drift and corrects it.

{{< figure src="slide-2-infrastructure-became-code.png" alt="Continuous loop diagram: declare, reconcile, observe drift, correct." caption="The control loop, not the YAML, is what made infrastructure reliable." >}}

Backup should be driven by the same loop. That's why we believe **resilience as
code is the future of backup**. A future where backup is no longer a separate
process, it is driven from the tools that run your platform.

## Where are you on the resilience maturity curve?

That's a question we often ask our users. The responses we get vary quite a bit
in terms of level of encryption, immutability, restorability, number of copies
and operational automations.

{{< figure src="resilience-maturity-curve.png" alt="The resilience maturity curve, from Level 0 (Unaware) to Level 6 (Resilience as Code)." caption="The resilience maturity curve: from no backup at Level 0 to Resilience as Code at Level 6." >}}

With Resilience as Code, backup is no longer a separate process added on top of
your platform. It is a property of the system from the start:

- **Declared, not operated.** What you protect, and how, lives in Git and
  Kubernetes, versioned and reviewed like any other config, and the platform
  keeps it true. Nobody clicks through a console, and nobody has to remember to
  protect the new service.
- **Encrypted end to end, so the storage sees nothing.** Keys stay under your
  control, and your hosting provider cannot read your data.
- **Proven continuously.** Recovery is not a test you run once and hope it still
  works when you need it. Snapshots are verified on an ongoing basis, and you
  can browse into one and pull back exactly what you need.

{{< figure src="slide-3-the-model.png" alt="The four terms of the resilience model: inventory, policy, reconciliation, assertion." caption="Inventory, policy, reconciliation, assertion: the Custom Resources below map onto these four terms." >}}

A few months back, we took a first step in that direction by introducing a
[Kubernetes integration](/posts/2026-02-18/backing-up-kubernetes-clusters-with-plakar/).
Today, we're taking another step towards making that vision a reality by
introducing the **Plakar Kubernetes Operator**. It exposes the entire Plakar
Control Plane as Kubernetes Custom Resources and keeps them continuously
reconciled, so you declare resilience for everything you run in the same way you
already manage your infrastructure.

## Declare it, and let the operator reconcile it

The Plakar Kubernetes Operator introduces a small set of Custom Resource kinds
that map to how you actually think about resilience:

- `Source`: what to protect.
- `Store`: where snapshots land.
- `Destination`: where a restore goes.
- `ScheduleBackup`, `ScheduleSync`, `ScheduleCheck`: recurring backups,
  replication, and integrity checks.
- `Restore`: recover on demand.

Each kind maps one to one onto a Control Plane resource, and the operator keeps
them in sync. Take a real example, a WordPress deployment with its MariaDB
database. That is two things worth protecting: the uploads on a PVC and the
database behind it. As code, they are two `Source` objects in the same
directory:

```yaml
apiVersion: connector.plakar.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pvc
spec:
  endpoint: /wordpress/data-pvc
  protocol: k8s+csi
  integration:
    name: k8s
    version: v1.1.7
  environment: production
  fieldsFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: kubeconfig
  fields:
    volume_snapshot_class:
      value: my-snapclass
```

Three details matter here. `protocol: k8s+csi` reads the volume straight through
the CSI snapshot interface, so you get a consistent point-in-time copy even
while WordPress is writing to it. `integration.version` is pinned, so a backup
taken today and a restore run in six months behave identically. And sensitive
values come `fieldsFrom` a Secret, so the manifest is safe to commit and review
in the open.

Add a `Store` and a `ScheduleBackup`, and that is the entire backup policy for
the app: four files, in Git, reviewed together.

## Reconciliation, not a cron job

The point is not that you can apply a YAML file. It is that the operator runs a
control loop. Your desired state lives in Git. Argo CD or Flux syncs it into the
cluster. The operator watches those resources and continuously drives the
Control Plane toward the declared state, then reports back. Each resource
exposes its Control Plane identity through `status.id` and its health through
standard conditions (`Available`, `Progressing`, `Degraded`), so `kubectl get`
and `kubectl describe` work exactly as you expect.

That means a degraded backup is not a surprise you find during an incident. It
is a condition on an object, alerting the same way a failing Deployment does.

Recovery is the part that actually matters. With snapshots stored as a structure
you can browse, you can restore a single path or a single resource instead of
rehydrating an entire volume to get one file back.

## It does not stop at the cluster edge

Here is the design decision we are most convinced by: a `Source` does not have
to be a PVC. A `Source` can be a database, a SaaS application, a filesystem, or
an object store, so the same declarative model governs protection for everything
you run from the place your platform team already works.

Unlike Velero which protects what runs inside the cluster, Plakar lets your
cluster protect everything else too, under one control plane, declared the same
way.

## Terraform and Ansible, too

The Kubernetes Operator is not the only way to declare resilience as code.
Plakar also ships
[Terraform](/docs/control-plane/infrastructure-as-code/terraform/) and
[Ansible](/docs/control-plane/infrastructure-as-code/ansible/) providers that
configure the Plakar Control Plane from code. Stores, connectors, schedules,
inventories, organizations and the roles held within them are declared in `.tf`
or Ansible files and reconciled with `terraform apply` (or its Ansible
equivalent), instead of being created by hand in the web interface.

{{< figure src="terraform-ansible-providers.png" alt="The Policy concept: desired state expressed as intent in a policy.yaml, available through the Terraform and Ansible providers." caption="Policy is intent, not procedure. Declare it once and apply it through the Terraform or Ansible provider." >}}

Under the hood, both providers call the Control Plane API to create, update and
read those objects. Plakar still performs every backup, restore, sync and check
itself, so you version and review your resilience like the rest of your
infrastructure, whichever front-end your platform team prefers.

## Getting Started

You can learn more about
[Plakar Kubernetes Operator in our documentation](/docs/control-plane/infrastructure-as-code/kubernetes-operator/).

The Free plan is the easiest way to discover and get started with the Plakar
Control Plane. It supports up to 500GB of managed data, making it well suited
for small configurations, personal use, or evaluating the platform before
committing to a larger deployment. Select your provider here to
[get started with the installation](/docs/control-plane/intro/installation/).
