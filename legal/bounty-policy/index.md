## 1. Objective and Economic Interest

Plakar SAS is dedicated to developing a secure, open-source, and highly
versatile data resilience ecosystem. This program is designed to incentivize the
global development and security community to actively contribute to the Plakar
ecosystem. By rewarding targeted feature implementations and high-impact
vulnerability discoveries, we aim to accelerate our roadmap and maintain
world-class security standards.

The economic and strategic interests of this program include:

- **Accelerating Feature Innovation:** Expanding Plakar utility by encouraging
  the community to build specific capabilities and integration packages.
- **Optimizing Engineering Costs:** Leveraging global developer talent to scale
  development efficiently across our public open-source repositories and related
  dependencies.
- **Enhancing Security and Resilience:** Identifying and resolving software
  vulnerabilities proactively before they can affect our users.
- **Community Enrichment:** Building a highly engaged ecosystem of open-source
  contributors, independent developers, and security researchers.

## 2. Technical Scope and Eligibility Rules

This program is open to individuals and legal entities worldwide, with the
strict exception of individuals residing in, or legal entities established in,
countries or territories subject to European Union (EU) or French economic
sanctions, trade embargoes, or comprehensive financial restrictions.
Furthermore, any individual or entity listed on official EU or French
asset-freeze and international sanctions registries is strictly ineligible to
participate or receive financial rewards.

### Program Exclusions

Employees of Plakar SAS, as well as freelancers, independent contractors, or
consultants currently under active contract or agreement with Plakar SAS, are
strictly excluded from participating in this program and are not eligible to
receive any financial rewards or public recognition under this policy.

### Reward Eligibility Rules

- **Security Scope:** Financial rewards are strictly limited to vulnerabilities
  classified as Critical or High based on standard metrics. Lower severity
  findings (Medium or Low) do not qualify for financial payouts but receive
  public recognition and thanks.
- **Features and Integrations Scope:** Financial rewards are strictly limited to
  the specific development tasks, features, and integration packages listed in
  the official Plakar Bounty Roadmap on our website ([the Bounty
  Roadmap][bounty-roadmap]). Unlisted feature suggestions do not qualify for
  financial payouts.
- **Upstream and Downstream Projects:** Certain development tasks targeting
  approved upstream or downstream open-source projects are eligible for rewards,
  provided they are explicitly framed and listed within the official Bounty
  Roadmap on our website ([the Bounty Roadmap][bounty-roadmap]).
- **Precedence of the Official Roadmap:** The official Bounty Roadmap on the
  Plakar website ([the Bounty Roadmap][bounty-roadmap]) takes precedence and
  dictates the definitive payout amounts if any discrepancy arises with the
  general ranges announced in this policy.
- **Licensing Requirement:** All contributions (including source code,
  documentation, and integration packages) must be submitted under the same
  open-source license as the respective target Plakar repository. By
  participating in this program, contributors explicitly agree to license their
  work under these terms.

### Safe Harbor (Legal Sanctuary)

Plakar SAS values the work of security researchers who help protect our users.
If you conduct your security research and vulnerability disclosure activities in
strict accordance with the rules, scope, and restrictions outlined in this
policy, Plakar SAS considers your research to be authorized.

Plakar SAS formally commits not to initiate legal actions, civil lawsuits, or
criminal complaints against you regarding your research. This safe harbor
explicitly covers potential claims under French penal code provisions regarding
fraudulent access, tampering, or remaining within an automated data processing
system.

### General Participation Criteria

- Participants must act in good faith and follow responsible disclosure
  practices.
- Feature contributions must align with Plakar architectural guidelines and pass
  code quality reviews.
- For security vulnerabilities, public disclosure without explicit prior
  authorization from Plakar SAS is strictly prohibited and results in immediate
  disqualification.

## 3. Submission and Evaluation Procedure

To maintain transparency and satisfy corporate accounting requirements under
French law, all submissions must follow a structured validation workflow.

### For Feature Contributions and Integrations

1. **Notification (Optional):** Before developing major features or
   integrations, contributors may notify the team by sending a brief functional
   outline or issue draft to bounty@plakar.io to check roadmap alignment. Plakar
   SAS does not guarantee exclusivity, and multiple participants may work on the
   same task independently.
2. **Implementation:** Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the relevant public
   repository, referencing the specific targeted item from the Bounty Roadmap
   available on our website ([the Bounty Roadmap][bounty-roadmap]).
3. **Review and Merge:** The Plakar maintainer team will review the code.
4. **Claiming the Reward (Claim):** Once the PR is approved and merged, the
   contributor must explicitly claim their bounty by sending an email to
   bounty@plakar.io. The reward is strictly attributed to the first valid,
   complete, and merged Pull Request.

### For Bug and Vulnerability Reports

1. **Reporting:** Send a detailed description along with reproduction steps
   securely via email to both security@plakar.io and bounty@plakar.io.
2. **Triage:** The engineering team will assess the impact and verify if the
   vulnerability meets the Critical or High classification criteria within five
   business days.

### Corporate Record Keeping

Plakar SAS permanently retains all technical exchanges, feature specifications,
vulnerability reports, and reward decisions. Under French legal frameworks, this
documentation is mandatory to justify corporate expenses and confirm the reality
of the services delivered to the company.

## 4. Rewards

Plakar pays for two kinds of contribution: security vulnerabilities, and the
development tasks listed on our official Bounty Roadmap on the Plakar website
([the Bounty Roadmap][bounty-roadmap]). Both programs are active and funded.
For development tasks, the roadmap remains the final authority on which tasks are eligible.

What we no longer publish are the payout figures.

We used to, and the tables turned out to be an excellent magnet for automated,
LLM-generated submissions. They look credible at first glance, they cite real
function names from our codebase, they use the right vocabulary, they arrive
pre-formatted to look like the thing we asked for. On examination they collapse.
Every one of them still cost us a real review, done by the same small team that
builds Plakar, and the volume became untenable. So the numbers are gone: not
crawled, not scraped, not usable as a price list to aim a bot at.

The consequence for anyone contributing in good faith is small.
Talk to us first, in both programs, and we agree the amount with you directly.

### Security Vulnerability Rewards

The bogus reports followed recurring patterns: severity inflation (a minor bug
filed as critical), threat models that require the victim to actively cooperate
with the attacker (install a malicious plugin the attacker wrote themselves),
and, in one case we still think about, an attack on a repository by someone who
did not hold the key ... demonstrated by using the key to decrypt part of the
repository.

If you have found a vulnerability, write to **security@plakar.io** with a brief
description of the issue and a working reproduction: the exact steps, commands,
or code that demonstrate the flaw against a real Plakar setup. A report without
a reproduction we can run is not something we can evaluate, and we will not
chase one down for you. We will first confirm we are talking to a human, then
assess the finding on its merits and discuss compensation with you if it is
legitimate. Severity is still evaluated against CVSS, and critical and high
findings are still rewarded, we simply do that assessment with you rather than
advertising the numbers to crawlers.

### Feature and Integration Rewards

Two categories are eligible, and only for tasks explicitly listed on the Bounty
Roadmap:

- **Integration**: a full, turnkey Integration Package, providing source,
  destination and storage connectors for an enterprise system listed on the
  roadmap.
- **Feature**: architectural components, performance optimizations, or
  functional tools listed on the roadmap, including listed upstream and
  downstream project developments.

Amounts depend on the difficulty of the specific task and are agreed before you
start, not after you submit. Claim the task by writing to
**<bounty@plakar.io>** with the roadmap item you want, a short outline of how
you intend to implement it, and enough about yourself for us to establish we are
talking to a human. We will confirm the task is unclaimed, agree the reward with
you, and only then do you write any code.

Unsolicited pull requests against roadmap items are welcome as contributions but
carry no reward. We do not pay for code we did not agree to in advance, which is
the only defence we have found against generated submissions that pattern-match
a roadmap entry without implementing it.

## 5. Invoicing, Payout, and Tax Compliance

All financial rewards are processed and paid from France by Plakar SAS. Payout
workflows depend strictly on the legal and tax status of the beneficiary.

### General Payout Conditions

- **Payment Timeframe:** Validated rewards will be executed via bank wire
  transfer within 30 days following the formal approval and validation of the
  commercial invoice or the individual signed certificate.
- **Transfer Fees:** Plakar SAS will absorb all standard bank wire transfer fees
  associated with processing and issuing the bounty payout.

### For Registered Businesses and Freelancers

If you participate as a company, sole trader, or registered freelancer, you must
issue a valid commercial invoice before payment can be executed.

- **Invoice Details:** Invoices must be addressed to Plakar SAS (149 avenue du
  Maine, 75014 Paris, France, RCS Paris 933 509 754).
- **Value Added Tax (VAT):**
  - French entities must include the standard French VAT.
  - European Union entities (outside France) must utilize the reverse charge
    mechanism and display their intra-community VAT number.
  - International entities outside the European Union must invoice without VAT,
    in compliance with applicable export regulations.

### For Private Individuals

If you participate as an individual contributor without a registered business,
the payout is processed under non-commercial corporate expense guidelines.

- **Accounting Treatment:** The payout is handled as a gross corporate charge
  (TTC). Plakar SAS cannot deduct or recover VAT on this transaction.
- **Mandatory Certificate (Attestation):** To receive the bounty payout,
  individual contributors must provide a signed certificate. The template
  provided in Appendix A must be fully completed and signed. No funds will be
  wired without this valid document.
- **Tax Responsibility:** This reward constitutes taxable income for the
  recipient. The beneficiary is explicitly informed that they are solely
  responsible for declaring this income to their local tax authorities. Plakar
  SAS will issue a payment confirmation document upon request to support
  individual tax declarations.
